### the concept of risk
#### LO 1.1: Explain the concept of risk and compare risk management with risk taking.
- there is a natural trade-off between risk and return
- The more important concern is the variability of the loss, especially a loss that could rise to unexpectedly high levels or a loss that suddenly occurs that was not anticipated.
- risk management includes the sequence of activities aimed to reduce or eliminate an entity’s potential to incur expected losses.
- Risk taking refers specifically to the active assumption of incremental risk in order to generate incremental gains.

### the risk management process
#### LO 1.2: Describe the risk management process and identify problems and challenges that can arise in the risk management process.
- Five steps: 
  - Step 1: Identify the risks.
  - Step 2: Quantify and estimate the risk exposures or determine appropriate methods to transfer the risks.
  - Step 3: Determine the collective effects of the risk exposures or perform a cost-benefit analysis on risk transfer methods.
  - Step 4: Develop a risk mitigation strategy (i.e., avoid, transfer, mitigate, or assume risk).
  - Step 5: Assess performance and amend risk mitigation strategy as needed.
- Two key problems
  - identifying the correct risk(s)
  - finding an efficient method of transferring the risk
- Chllenges:
  - risk must be sufficiently dispersed among willing and able participants in the economy
  - consistently assist in preventing market disruptions or preventing financial accounting fraud (due to corporate governance failures).
  - risk management may not be effective on an overall economic basis, a zero-sum game

### measure and manage risk
#### LO 1.3: Evaluate and apply tools and procedures used to measure and manage risk, including quantitative measures, qualitative assessment, and enterprise risk management.
- Quantitative Measures
  - Value at risk (VaR) states a certain loss amount and its probability of occurring. VaR is a useful measure for liquid positions operating under normal market circumstances over a short period of time.
  - Economic capital refers to holding sufficient liquid reserves to cover a potential loss.
- Qualitative Assessment
  - Scenario analysis takes into account potential risk factors with uncertainties that are often non-quantifiable.
    - an adverse scenario or worst-case scenario analysis
  - Stress testing is a form of scenario analysis that examines a financial outcome based on a given “stress” on the entity.
- Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
  - ERM considers entity-wide risks and tries to integrate risk considerations into key business decisions.

### expected loss and unexpected loss
#### LO 1.4: Distinguish between expected loss and unexpected loss, and provide examples o f each.
in advance, with ease, certainty
- Expected loss considers how much an entity expects to lose in the normal course of business.
- Unexpected loss considers how much an entity could lose outside of the normal course of business.
  - correlation risk drives up the potential losses to unexpected levels <- historical analysis

### risk and reward
#### LO 1.5: Interpret the relationship between risk and reward and explain how conflicts o f interest can impact risk management.
- variability of the potential reward. 
  - The portion of the variability that is measurable as a probability function could be thought of as risk whereas the portion that is not measurable could be thought of as uncertainty.
