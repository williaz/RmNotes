### the concept of risk
#### LO 1.1: Explain the concept of risk and compare risk management with risk taking.
- there is a natural trade-off between risk and return
- The more important concern is the variability of the loss, especially a loss that could rise to unexpectedly high levels or a loss that suddenly occurs that was not anticipated.
- risk management includes the sequence of activities aimed to reduce or eliminate an entity’s potential to incur expected losses.
- Risk taking refers specifically to the active assumption of incremental risk in order to generate incremental gains.

### the risk management process
#### LO 1.2: Describe the risk management process and identify problems and challenges that can arise in the risk management process.
- Five steps: 
  - Step 1: Identify the risks.
  - Step 2: Quantify and estimate the risk exposures or determine appropriate methods to transfer the risks.
  - Step 3: Determine the collective effects of the risk exposures or perform a cost-benefit analysis on risk transfer methods.
  - Step 4: Develop a risk mitigation strategy (i.e., avoid, transfer, mitigate, or assume risk).
  - Step 5: Assess performance and amend risk mitigation strategy as needed.
- Two key problems
  - identifying the correct risk(s)
  - finding an efficient method of transferring the risk
- Chllenges:
  - risk must be sufficiently dispersed among willing and able participants in the economy
  - consistently assist in preventing market disruptions or preventing financial accounting fraud (due to corporate governance failures).
  - risk management may not be effective on an overall economic basis, a zero-sum game

### measure and manage risk
#### LO 1.3: Evaluate and apply tools and procedures used to measure and manage risk, including quantitative measures, qualitative assessment, and enterprise risk management.
- Quantitative Measures
  - Value at risk (VaR) states a certain loss amount and its probability of occurring. VaR is a useful measure for liquid positions operating under normal market circumstances over a short period of time.
  - Economic capital refers to holding sufficient liquid reserves to cover a potential loss.
- Qualitative Assessment
  - Scenario analysis takes into account potential risk factors with uncertainties that are often non-quantifiable.
    - an adverse scenario or worst-case scenario analysis
  - Stress testing is a form of scenario analysis that examines a financial outcome based on a given “stress” on the entity.
- Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
  - ERM considers entity-wide risks and tries to integrate risk considerations into key business decisions.

### expected loss and unexpected loss
#### LO 1.4: Distinguish between expected loss and unexpected loss, and provide examples o f each.
in advance, with ease, certainty
- Expected loss considers how much an entity expects to lose in the normal course of business.
- Unexpected loss considers how much an entity could lose outside of the normal course of business.
  - **correlation risk drives up the potential losses to unexpected levels** <- historical analysis

### risk and reward
#### LO 1.5: Interpret the relationship between risk and reward and explain how conflicts o f interest can impact risk management.
- variability of the potential reward. 
  - The portion of the variability that is measurable as a probability function could be thought of as risk whereas the portion that is not measurable could be thought of as uncertainty.

### classes of risks
#### LO 1.6: Describe and differentiate between the key classes of risks, explain how each type o f risk can arise, and assess the potential impact o f each type o f risk on an organization.
- Market risk: how changes in market prices and rates will result in investment losses.
  - (1) interest rate risk
  - (2) equity price risk: volatility of stock prices, general market risk & specific risk
  - (3) foreign exchange risk: unhedged or not fully hedged foreign currency positions.
  - (4) commodity price risk
- Credit risk: a loss suffered by a party whereby the counterparty fails to meet its financial obligations to the party under the contract.
  - (1) default risk
  - (2) bankruptcy risk
  - (3) downgrade risk: publicly traded
  - (4) settlement risk
- Liquidity Risk
  - (1) funding liquidity risk
  - (2) trading liquidity risk
- Operational Risk: non-financial risk
- Legal and Regulatory Risk
- Business Risk: income nstatement
- Strategic risk
- Reputation Risk
  - (1) the general perceived trustworthiness of an entity
  - (2) the general perception that the entity engages in fair dealing and conducts business in an ethical manner.

### hedging risk exposures
#### LO 2.1: Evaluate some advantages and disadvantages of hedging risk exposures.
- perfect capital markets

### hedging decisions
#### LO 2.2: Explain considerations and procedures in determining a firm’s risk appetite and its business objectives.
#### LO 2.3: Explain how a company can determine whether to hedge specific risk factors, including the role of the board of directors and the process of mapping risks.
- A major conclusion to consider with the risk/return trade-off is that firms should accept all projects with a positive net present value (NPV), taking into account risk, because it will maximize value for the firm’s stakeholders.
- a firm must know its risk and return goals before embarking on a risk management plan.
- firm’s risk appetite, approved by the board of directors
- conflict between the two major stakeholders—debtholders and shareholders.
- The bottom line is that it is not possible to hedge both accounting and economic risk at the same time, so a choice between the two must be made.
- the issue of hedging short-term versus long-term accounting profits
- time horizon
- Liquidity, accounting, and tax effects need to be considered.
- implement definitive and quantitative risk limits
- the firm should also research and identify the top 10 risk exposures it faces.

### hedge operational and financial risks
#### LO 2.4: Apply appropriate methods to hedge operational and financial risks, including pricing, foreign currency, and interest rate risk.
- Pricing Risk: the cost of inputs <- 
- The goal of hedging foreign currency risk is to control exposure to exchange rate fluctuations that impact future cash flows and the fair value of assets and liabilities.
- foreign exchange rate fluctuations <- forward or futures contract locking cost
  - currency put options (to ensure a known absolute minimum return should the exchange rate fall beyond the strike rate) 
  - forward contracts (to ensure a known return based on n exchange rate determined in advance and acceptable by the firm)
- The goal of hedging interest rate risk is to control the firm’s net exposure (asset or liability) to unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. <- interest rate swaps
- Static vs. Dynamic Hedging Strategies
- hedging considerations:
  - relevant time horizons for hedging -> performance evaluations
  - complex financial accounting
  - tax, law

### risk management instruments
#### LO 2.5: Assess the impact of risk management instruments.
- time horizon
- fully insure, partially insure, or not to insure (i.e., self-insure)
- exchange traded or over the counter (OTC)
