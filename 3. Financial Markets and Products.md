- Commercial banks are those that take deposits and make loans. Commercial banks include retail banks, which primarily serve individuals and small businesses, and wholesale banks, which primarily serve corporate and institutional customers.
- Investment banks are those that assist in raising capital for their customers (e.g., by managing the issuance of debt and equity securities) and advising them on corporate finance matters such as mergers and restructurings.

#### LO 31.1: Identify the major risks faced by a bank.
- The main risks faced by a bank include credit risk, market risk, and operational risk.

#### LO 31.2: Distinguish between economic capital and regulatory capital.
- To mitigate the risk of bank failures caused by losses on loans or trading assets, banks must be funded by adequate sources of capital.
- Regulatory capital refers to the amount determined by bank regulators. In terms of bank regulation, equity is referred to as “Tier 1 capital” and subordinated long-term debt is referred to as “Tier 2 capital.”
- Economic capital refers to the amount of capital that a bank believes is adequate based on its own risk models.

#### LO 31.3: Explain how deposit insurance gives rise to a moral hazard problem.
- To increase public confidence in the banking system and prevent runs on banks, most countries have established systems of deposit insurance.
- Moral hazard is the observed phenomenon that insured parties take greater risks than they would normally take if they were not insured.
- One way of mitigating moral hazard is by making insurance premiums risk-based.

#### LO 31.4: Describe investment banking financing arrangements including private placement, public offering, best efforts, firm commitment, and Dutch auction approaches.
- In a **private placement**, securities are sold directly to qualified investors with substantial wealth and investment knowledge.
  - fee income
- If the securities are sold to the investing public at large, the issuance is referred to as a **public offering**.
  - With a **firm commitment**, the investment bank agrees to purchase the entire issue at a price that is negotiated between the issuer and bank.
    - spread
  - An investment bank can also agree to distribute an issue on a **best efforts** basis rather than agreeing to purchase the whole issue.
- First-time issues of stock by firms whose shares are not currently publicly traded are called initial public offerings (IPOs).
- Dutch auction begins with a price greater than what any bidder will pay, and this price is reduced until a bidder agrees to pay it.
  - Each bidder may specify how many units they will purchase when accepting a price.
  - The price continues to be reduced until bidders have accepted all the shares. 
  - The price at which the last of the shares can be sold becomes the price paid by all successful bidders.


#### LO 31.5: Describe the potential conflicts of interest among commercial banking, securities services, and investment banking divisions o f a bank and recommend solutions to the conflict o f interest problems.
- securiteis services pressure from IB
- material nonpublic information.
- Chinese walls

#### LO 31.6: Describe the distinctions between the “banking book” and the “trading book” o f a bank.

- The banking book refers to loans made, which are the primary assets of a commercial bank.
- a nonperforming loan the value does not include accrued interest. 
  - A loan is typically classified as nonperforming if payments are more than 90 days overdue.

- The trading book refers to assets and liabilities related to a bank’s trading activities.
  - marked to market daily
  - marked to model


#### LO 31.7: Explain the originate-to-distribute model of a bank and discuss its benefits and drawbacks.
- In contrast to a bank making loans and keeping them as assets, the originate-to-distribute model involves making loans and selling them to other parties.
  - freeing up capital
  - increase liquidity in sectors of the loan market
  - led banks to loosen lending standards


#### LO 32.1: Describe the key features o f the various categories o f insurance companies and identify the risks facing insurance companies.

- Three categories of insurance companies include life insurance, property and casualty (nonlife) insurance, and health insurance.
- term and whole life insurance
- Property insurance covers property losses such as fire and theft.

- Casualty (liability) insurance covers third-party liability for injuries sustained while on a policyholder’s premises or caused by the policyholder’s use of a vehicle
  - Liability insurance is subject to long-tail risk

- Major risks facing insurance companies
  - Insufficient funds to satisfy policyholders’ claims
  - Poor return on investments
  - Liquidity risk o f investments
  - Credit risk
  - Operational risk


#### LO 32.2: Describe the use o f mortality tables and calculate the premium payment for a policy holder.

- When examining the full table, the probability of death during the following year is a decreasing function of age until age 10 and then it increases.

- With the information in the mortality tables, we can calculate the breakeven premium payment by equating the present value of the expected payout to the present value of the expected premium payments


#### LO 32.3: Calculate and interpret loss ratio, expense ratio, combined ratio, and operating ratio for a property-casualty insurance company.

- The loss ratio for a given year is the percentage of payouts versus premiums generated, usually between 60—80% and increasing over time.
- The expense ratio for a given year is the percentage of expenses versus premiums generated, usually between 23—30% and decreasing over time. The largest expenses are usually loss adjustments (e.g., claims investigation and assessing payout amounts) and selling (e.g., broker commissions).
- The combined ratio for a given year is equal to the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio.
- The combined ratio after dividends for a given year is equal to the combined ratio plus the payment of dividends to policyholders (if applicable).
- The operating ratio for a given year is the combined ratio (after dividends) less
investment income.


#### LO 32.4: Describe moral hazard and adverse selection risks facing insurance companies, provide examples o f each, and describe how to overcome the problems.

- Moral hazard describes the risk to the insurance company that having insurance will lead the policyholder to act more recklessly than if the policyholder did not have insurance.
- Methods to mitigate against moral hazard include: deductibles (e.g., policyholder is responsible for a fixed amount of the loss), coinsurance provisions (e.g., insurance company will pay a fixed percentage of losses, less than 100%, over the deductible amount), and policy limits (e.g., fixed maximum payout).

- Adverse selection describes the situation where an insurer is unable to differentiate between a good risk and a bad risk.
- Methods to mitigate against adverse selection include: (1) greater initial due diligence (e.g., mandatory physical examinations for life insurance, researching driving records for automobile insurance) and (2) ongoing due diligence (e.g., updating driving records and adjusting premiums to reflect changing risk).

## LO 32.5: Distinguish between mortality risk and longevity risk and describe how to hedge these risks.

- Mortality risk refers to the risk of policyholders dying earlier than expected due to illness or disease, for example.
- Longevity risk refers to the risk of policyholders living longer than expected due to better healthcare and healthier lifestyle choices, for example
- There is a natural hedge (or offset) for insurance companies that deal with both life insurance products and annuity products.
  - longevity risk good for the life insurance
  - Mortality risk is good for the annuity business

- To the extent that there is excessive net exposure to mortality risk, longevity risk, or both, an insurance company may consider reinsurance contracts.

## LO 32.6: Evaluate the capital requirements for life insurance and property-casualty insurance companies. 
- life insurance
  - Assets: investments (80%), other assets (20%)
  - Liabilities and Equity: policy reserves (85%), subordinated long-term debt (5%), equity capital (10%)
- A P&C insurance company
  - Assets: investments (80%), other assets (20%)
  - Liabilities and Equity: policy reserves (50%), unearned premiums (10%), subordinated long-term debt (5%), equity capital (35%)
- Under an asset-liability management approach, the life insurance company attempts to equate asset duration with liability duration.
- For P&C insurance companies, assets typically comprise of highly liquid bonds with shorter maturities than those used by life insurance companies.
#### LO 32.7: Compare the guaranty system and the regulatory requirements for insurance companies with those for banks.
- In the United States, a guaranty system exists for both insurance companies and banks. Insurance companies are regulated at the state level while banks are regulated at the federal level.
- insurance companies must make contributions whenever a default occurs.
- the guaranty system for banks is a permanent fund to protect depositors and consists of amounts remitted by banks to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

#### LO 32.8: Describe a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan for a pension fund and explain the differences between them.
- Defined benefit plans (i.e., employee benefit known, employer contribution unknown) explicitly state the amount of the pension that the employee will receive upon retirement.

- Defined contribution plans (i.e., employer contribution known, employee benefit unknown) involve both employer and employee contributions being invested in one or more investment options selected by the employee.


- Liability insurance is subject to long-tail risk, which is the risk of legitimate claims being submitted years after the insurance coverage has ended.


#### LO 33.1: Differentiate among open-end mutual funds, closed-end mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
- Mutual funds are pooled investment vehicles that offer instant diversification for their investors.
- Open-end mutual funds, which are often simply called mutual funds, are the most common pooled investment vehicle
  - broken down into four main categories: money market funds, equity funds, bond funds, and hybrid funds
  - Open-end funds trade at the fund’s net asset value (NAV), which is essentially the sum of all assets owned minus any liabilities of the fund then divided by the shares outstanding.
  - poor price visibility
- Sales charges are commonly called loads. A front-end load is a set percentage that is charged to the investor when the asset is originally sold. Alternatively, some funds choose to charge a sales charge if an investor leaves a fund within a certain window of time. This is called a back-end load.


- The first difference is that closed-end funds tend to invest in niche areas like specific emerging markets, while open-end mutual funds tend to invest in broader areas like a diversified emerging markets fund.
- The second difference is that a purchase of shares in an open-end mutual fund will increase the number of shares outstanding because new shares are created, but a closed-end fund’s number of shares remains static.
  - Investors who desire to purchase shares of a closed-end fund do not transact direcdy with the fund company but rather with other investors.
- It is very common for a closed-end fund to trade at either a discount or a premium to its actual NAV.
- Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent an innovative twist on the open-end mutual fund.
  - exchange-traded
  - vast majority of ETFs are passively managed index funds

- They are all regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and must register with the SEC and provide a very detailed disclosure document, called a prospectus, to all investors prior to investing.

#### LO 33.2: Calculate the net asset value (NAY) of an open-end mutual fund.
- NAV = (fund assets — fund liabilities) / total shares outstanding

#### LO 33.3: Explain the key differences between hedge funds and mutual funds.

- Hedge funds are also permitted to use leverage while mutual funds are not.
  - advance notification. 90d
  - lock-up period
  - illiquid

#### LO 33.4: Calculate the return on a hedge fund investment and explain the incentive fee structure of a hedge fund including the terms hurdle rate, high-water mark, and clawback.
- These incentive fees are engineered to give hedge fund managers significant payouts based on their performance. The typical hedge fund fee structure is known as “2 plus 20%,”
  - The first safeguard is the hurdle rate, which is the benchmark that must be beaten before incentive fees can be charged\
  - The second safeguard is a high-water mark clause, which essentially states that previous losses must first be recouped and hurdle rates surpassed before incentive fees once again apply.

  - The third safeguard for investors is a clawback clause, which enables investors to retain a portion of previously paid incentive fees in an escrow account that is used to offset investment losses should they occur.
  - encouraging fund managers to take risks

- LO 33.5: Describe various hedge fund strategies, including long/short equity, dedicated short, distressed securities, merger arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, fixed income arbitrage, emerging markets, global macro, and managed fixtures, and identify the risks faced by hedge funds.

- Long/short equity hedge funds endeavor to find mispriced securities.
  - fundamental analysis
  - sector neutral, Market neutralfunds, factor neutral funds
- Dedicated short hedge funds are focused exclusively on finding a company that they think is overvalued and then short selling the stock.

- Bonds with a credit rating of BB or less are considered to be “junk” bonds, while those with a CCC rating are considered to be “distressed.”
  - passively wait, active approach to influencing
- Merger arbitrage hedge funds try to find arbitrage opportunities after mergers are announced.
  - cash deals and stock deals.
  - great potential for insider trading issues.
- Fixed income arbitrage hedge funds attempt to exploit perceived mispricings in the realm of fixed-income securities.
  - picking up nickels in front of a steamroller.

- Emerging market hedge funds focus on investments in developing countries.
  - American depository receipts (ADRs)
- hedge fund managers attempt to profit from a global macroeconomic trend that they feel is not in equilibrium (priced correctly and rationally).

- Managed futures hedge funds attempt to predict future movements in commodity prices based on either technical analysis or fundamental analysis.

#### LO 33.6: Describe hedge fund performance and explain the effect o f measurement biases on performance measurement.

- measurement bias of hedge fund index reporting
- When returns are reported by a hedge fund, the database is then backfilled with the fund’s previous returns.
- Protection during periods of stock market volatility is one hallmark of hedge funds as they actively pursue short selling when traditional mutual funds are not allowed to do so.


- Open-end mutual funds can only be bought or sold using a market order. Closed-end funds can be bought or sold using stop orders and limit orders. In some cases, ETFs can be sold short.

- An open outcry system and electronic trading system are different forms of trading securities (matching buyers with sellers). The open outcry system (e.g., CBOT) is the more traditional system, which involves traders actually indicating their trades through hand signals and shouting.

#### LO 34.1: Describe the over-the-counter market, distinguish it from trading on an exchange, and evaluate its advantages and disadvantages.
- Terms are not set by any exchange.
- negotiate
- calls are recorded
- more credit risk
#### LO 34.2: Differentiate between options, forwards, and futures contracts.

- A forward contract is a contract that specifies the price and quantity of an asset to be delivered sometime in the future.
- A futures contract is a more formalized, legally binding agreement to buy/sell a commodity/ financial instrument in a pre-designated month in the future, at a price agreed upon today by the buyer/seller.

#### LO 34.3: Identify and calculate option and forward contract payoffs.

- The price paid for the call option, CQ, is referred to as the call premium.

#### LO 34.4: Calculate and compare the payoffs from hedging strategies involving forward contracts and options.

- Hedgers use forward contracts and options to reduce or eliminate financial exposure.


#### LO 34.5: Calculate and compare the payoffs from speculative strategies involving futures and options.
- Speculators use derivatives to make bets on the market, while hedgers try to eliminate exposures.


#### LO 34.6: Calculate an arbitrage payoff and describe how arbitrage opportunities are temporary.
- Arbitrageurs are also frequent users of derivatives.

#### LO 34.7: Describe some of the risks that can arise from the use o f derivatives.



#### LO 35.1: Define and describe the key features of a futures contract, including the asset, the contract price and size, delivery, and limits.
#### LO 35.9: Compare and contrast forward and futures contracts.
- Most futures positions are not held to take delivery of the underlying good. Instead, they are closed out or reversed prior to the settlement date.
- Open interest is the total number of long positions in a given futures contract.

- Futures contract characteristics
  - Quality o f the underlying asset. Contract size.
  - Delivery location. Delivery time.
  - Price quotations and tick size. Daily price limits(limit down/up). Position limits.


#### LO 35.2: Explain the convergence of futures and spot prices.

- The basis is the difference between the spot price and the futures price.

#### LO 35.3: Describe the rationale for margin requirements and explain how they work.
- Margin is cash or highly liquid collateral placed in an account to ensure that any trading losses will be met.
- The amount required to open a futures position is called the initial margin. The maintenance margin is the minimum margin account balance required to retain the futures position.
- gets a margin call, and he must bring the margin account back to the initial margin amount. The amount necessary to do this is called the variation margin.


#### LO 35.4: Describe the role of a clearinghouse in futures and over-the-counter market transactions.


#### LO 35-5: Describe the role of collateralization in the over-the-counter market and compare it to the margining system.

#### LO 35.6: Identify the differences between a normal and inverted futures market.
- The settlement price is analogous to the closing price for a stock but is not simply the price of the last trade. It is an average of the prices of the trades during the last period of trading, called the closing period, which is set by the exchange.
- Increasing settlement prices over time indicates a normal market. Conversely, decreasing settlement prices over time indicates an inverted market

#### LO 35.7: Describe the mechanics o f the delivery process and contrast it with cash settlement.

#### LO 35.8: Evaluate the impact of different trading order types.

- A limit buy order is placed below the current price. A limit sell order is placed above the current price.

- Stop-limit orders: once the stop level is reached, or bettered, the order would turn into a limit order and hopefully transact at the limit price. 
- Market-if-touched orders, or MIT orders, are orders that would become market orders once a specified price is reached in the marketplace.

- Another difference is that capital losses are deductible for non-corporate taxpayers.
- Gains/losses on hedging transactions are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income.

- Determining which contracts will trade is a function of the exchange, not the clearinghouse.

#### LO 36.1: Define and differentiate between short and long hedges and identify their appropriate uses.


#### LO 36.2: Describe the arguments for and against hedging and the potential impact o f hedging on firm profitability.
- anticipatory hedge is an example of a long hedge, where the user locks in a future purchasing price.

#### LO 36.3: Define the basis and explain the various sources o f basis risk, and explain how basis risks arise when hedging with futures.
#### LO 36.4: Define cross hedging, and compute and interpret the minimum variance hedge ratio and hedge effectiveness.

- (1) the asset in the existing position is often not the same as that underlying the futures, and (2) the hedging horizon may not match perfectly with the maturity of the futures contract. The existence of either one of these conditions leads to what is called basis risk.
- basis is also sometimes defined as: futures price minus spot price, mostly when dealing with financial asset futures.

- Three sources of basis risk are: (1) interruption in the convergence of the futures and spot prices, (2) changes in the cost of carry, and (3) imperfect matching between the cash asset and the hedge asset.
- A hedge ratio is the ratio of the size of the futures position relative to the spot position. The optimal hedge ratio, which minimizes the variance of the combined hedge position

- HR = the correlation between the spot prices and the futures prices X (the standard deviation of the spot price/the standard deviation of the futures price) = the beta of spot prices with respect to futures contract prices

- The R^2 is the square of the correlation coefficient (p2) between spot and futures prices.

#### LO 36.5: Compute the optimal number of futures contracts needed to hedge an exposure, and explain and calculate the “tailing the hedge” adjustment.
- it is important to remember that the hedged portfolio’s beta serves as a hedge ratio when determining the correct number of contracts to purchase or sell.

- To correct for the possibility o f over-hedging, a hedger can implement a tailing the hedge strategy. The extra step needed to carry out this strategy is to multiply the hedge ratio by the daily spot price to futures price ratio.


#### LO 36.6: Explain how to use stock index futures contracts to change a stock portfolio s beta.

- number of contracts = (Beta* - Beta)X(P/A)
#### LO 36.7: Explain the term “rolling the hedge forward” and describe some o f the risks that arise from this strategy.
- rollover basis risk, or simply rollover risk


#### LO 37.1: Describe Treasury rates, LIBOR, and repo rates, and explain what is meant by the “risk-free” rate. *

- Treasury rates. Treasury rates are the rates that correspond to government borrowing in its own currency. They are considered risk-free rates.
- LIBOR. The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is the rate at which large international banks fund their activities.
- Repo rates. The “repo” or repurchase agreement rate is the implied rate on a repurchase agreement.

- an inverse floater is a debt instrument whose coupon payments fluctuate inversely with the reference rate (e.g., LIBOR).

#### LO 37.2: Calculate the value o f an investment using different compounding frequencies.
#### LO 37.3: Convert interest rates based on different compounding frequencies.

Rc = m\*ln(1 + R/m)

#### LO 37.4: Calculate the theoretical price o f a bond using spot rates.

- Spot rates are the rates that correspond to zero-coupon bond yields.
  - They are the appropriate discount rates for a single cash flow at a particular future time or maturity. 
  - Spot rates are also often called zero rates.

- The yield of a bond is the single discount rate that equates the present value of a bond to its market price.

- The bond’s par yield is the rate which makes the price of a bond equal to its par value.

- The theoretical spot curve is derived by interpreting each Treasury bond (T-bond) as a package of zero-coupon bonds. Using the prices for each bond, the spot curve is computed using the bootstrapping methodology.


#### LO 37.5: Derive forward interest rates from a set o f spot rates.

- Forward rates are interest rates implied by the spot curve for a specified future period.

#### LO 37.6: Derive the value o f the cash flows from a forward rate agreement (FRA).

- A forward rate agreement (FRA) is a forward contract obligating two parties to agree that a certain interest rate will apply to a principal amount during a specified future time.


#### LO 37.7: Calculate the duration, modified duration and dollar duration o f a bond.

- The duration of a bond is the average time until the cash flows on the bond are received.
- The duration of a bond is the average time until the cash flows on the bond are received.

- Modified duration is used when the yield given is something other than a continuously compounded rate.
- Dollar duration is simply modified duration multiplied by the price of the bond.


#### LO 37.8: Evaluate the limitations of duration and explain how convexity addresses some o f them.
- Duration is a good approximation of price changes for an option-free bond, but it’s only good for relatively small changes in interest rates.
- all convexity does is account for the amount of error in the estimated price change based on duration.
- for an option-free bond, the convexity effect is always positive, no matter which direction interest rates move.

- diff(B)/B = - duration\*diff(Y)

#### LO 37.9: Calculate the change in a bond’s price given its duration, its convexity, and a change in interest rates.

-   convexity effect = 0.5\*convexity\*diff(Y^2)

#### LO 37.10: Compare and contrast the major theories of the term structure of interest rates.

- The expectations theory suggests that forward rates correspond to expected future spot rates.
- The market segmentation theory states that the bond market is segmented into different maturity sectors and that supply and demand for bonds in each maturity range dictate rates in that maturity range.

- The liquidity preference theory suggests that most depositors prefer shortterm liquid deposits.


#### LO 38.1: Differentiate between investment and consumption assets.

- Examples of consumption assets include commodities such as oil and natural gas.

#### LO 38.2: Define short-selling and calculate the net profit o f a short sale of a dividend-paying stock.

- The short seller may be forced to close his position if the broker runs out of securities to borrow. This is known as a short squeeze, and the seller will need to close his short position immediately.
  - 1. The short seller must pay all dividends due to the lender o f the security.
  - 2. The short seller must deposit collateral to guarantee the eventual repurchase of the security.


#### LO 38.3: Describe the differences between forward and futures contracts and explain the relationship between forward and spot prices.
#### LO 38.4: Calculate the forward price given the underlying assets spot price, and describe an arbitrage argument between spot and forward prices.
#### LO 38.9: Calculate, using the cost-of-carry model, forward prices where the underlying asset either does or does not have interim cash flows.


#### LO 38.6: Calculate a forward foreign exchange rate using the interest rate parity relationship.
- Interest rate parity (IRP) states that the forward exchange rate, F (measured in domestic per unit of foreign currency), must be related to the spot exchange rate, S, and to the interest rate differential between the domestic and the foreign country, r — rf.

#### LO 38.5: Explain the relationship between forward and futures prices.

- The most significant difference between forward contracts and futures contracts is the daily marking to market requirement on futures contracts.


#### LO 38.7: Define income, storage costs, and convenience yield.
#### LO 38.8: Calculate the futures price on commodities incorporating income/storage costs and/or convenience yields.

- Consumption assets have actual storage costs associated with them.

- the convenience yield is simply the yield required to produce an equality and is thus a measure of the benefit of owning spot, or physical, consumption commodities.


#### LO 38.10: Describe the various delivery options available in the futures markets and how they can influence futures prices.


#### LO 38.11: Explain the relationship between current futures prices and expected future spot prices, including the impact o f systematic and nonsystematic risk.

- expectations model tates that the current futures price for delivery at time T is equal to the expected spot price at time T.

#### LO 38.12: Define and interpret contango and backwardation, and explain how they relate to the cost-of-carry model.

- Backwardation refers to a situation where the futures price is below the current spot price. For this to occur, there must be a significant benefit to holding the asset.

- Contango refers to a situation where the futures price is above the current spot price. If there are no benefits to holding the asset


#### LO 39.1: Identify the most commonly used day count conventions, describe the markets that each one is typically used in, and apply each to an interest calculation.

- 1. U.S. Treasury bonds use actual/actual.
- 2. U.S. corporate and municipal bonds use 30/360.
- 3. U.S. money market instruments (Treasury bills) use actual/360.


#### LO 39.3: Differentiate between the clean and dirty price for a US Treasury bond; calculate the accrued interest and dirty price on a US Treasury bond.

- T-bond prices are quoted relative to a $100 par amount in dollars and 32nds.
- The cash price (a.k.a. invoice price or dirty price) is the price that the seller of the bond must be paid to give up ownership. It includes the present value of the bond (a.k.a. quoted price or clean price) plus the accrued interest.

#### LO 39.2: Calculate the conversion o f a discount rate to a price for a US Treasury bill.

- T-bill discount rate = 360/n * (100 — Y)

#### LO 39.4: Explain and calculate a US Treasury bond futures contract conversion factor.
#### LO 39.3: Calculate the cost of delivering a bond into a Treasury bond futures contract.
#### LO 39.6: Describe the impact of the level and shape o f the yield curve on the cheapest-to-deliver Treasury bond decision.

- The CTD bond minimizes the following: quoted bond price - (QFP x CF).

- When yields > 6%, CTD bonds tend to be low-coupon, long-maturity bonds.
- When yields < 6%, CTD bonds tend to be high-coupon, short-maturity bonds.
- When the yield curve is upward sloping, CTD bonds tend to have longer maturities.
- When the yield curve is downward sloping, CTD bonds tend to have shorter maturities.


#### LO 39.7: Calculate the theoretical futures price for a Treasury bond futures contract.


#### LO 3 9 .8 : Calculate the final contract price on a Eurodollar fixtures contract.
#### LO 39.9: Describe and compute the Eurodollar fixtures contract convexity adjustment.

- The 3-month eurodollar fixtures contract trades on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and is the most popular interest rate futures in the United States.
- This contract settles in cash and the minimum price change is one “tick,” which is a price change of one basis point, or $23 per $ 1 million contract. Eurodollar futures are based on a eurodollar deposit (a eurodollar is a U.S. dollar deposited outside the United States) with a face amount of $ 1 million. 
- The interest rate underlying this contract is essentially the 3-month (90-day) forward LIBOR.

#### LO 39.10: Explain how Eurodollar futures can be used to extend the LIBOR zero curve.

- Forward rates implied by convexity-adjusted eurodollar futures can be used to produce a LIBOR spot curve (also called a LIBOR zero curve since spot rates are sometimes referred to as zero rates).

#### LO 39.11: Calculate the duration-based hedge ratio and create a duration-based hedging strategy using interest rate futures.

- The objective of a duration-based hedge is to create a combined position that does not change in value when yields change by a small amount. In other words, a position that has a duration of zero needs to be produced.


#### LO 39.12: Explain the limitations o f using a duration-based hedging strategy.

- duration implies that all yields are perfectly correlated

#### LO 40.1: Explain the mechanics o f a plain vanilla interest rate swap and compute its cash flows.

- The first cash flow takes place at the end of period one and uses the LIBOR at the beginning of that same period.

#### LO 40.2: Explain how a plain vanilla interest rate swap can be used to transform an asset or a liability and calculate the resulting cash flows.


#### LO 40.3: Explain the role of financial intermediaries in the swaps market.
#### LO 40.4: Describe the role of the confirmation in a swap transaction.

- Financial intermediaries, such as banks, will typically earn a spread of about 3 to 4 basis points for bringing two nonfinancial companies together in a swap agreement.
- If one of the parties defaults on its swap payments, the intermediary is responsible for making the other party whole.

- Confirmations, as drafted by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), outline the details of each swap agreement.


#### LO 40.5: Describe the comparative advantage argument for the existence of interest rate swaps and evaluate some o f the criticisms o f this argument.

- credit risk
- intermediary

#### LO 40.6: Explain how the discount rates in a plain vanilla interest rate swap are computed.

- It turns out that the forward rates implied by either forward rate agreements (FRAs) or the convexity-adjusted Eurodollar futures are used to produce a LIBOR spot curve.

#### LO 40.7: Calculate the value of a plain vanilla interest rate swap based on two simultaneous bond positions.

#### LO 40.8: Calculate the value of a plain vanilla interest rate swap from a sequence o f forward rate agreements (FRAs).
- One way to value a swap would be to use expected forward rates to forecast the expected net cash flows and then discount these expected cash flows at the corresponding spot rates, consistent with forward rate expectations.

#### LO 40.9: Explain the mechanics o f a currency swap and compute its cash flows.
#### LO 40.11: Calculate the value of a currency swap based on two simultaneous bond positions.

- A currency swap exchanges both principal and interest rate payments with payments in different currencies.
- The exchange rate used in currency swaps is the spot exchange rate.

#### LO 40.12: Calculate the value of a currency swap based on a sequence o f FRAs.

#### LO 40.10: Explain how a currency swap can be used to transform an asset or liability and calculate the resulting cash flows.

#### LO 40.13: Describe the credit risk exposure in a swap position.

- A swaption is an option which gives the holder the right to enter into an interest rate swap.
