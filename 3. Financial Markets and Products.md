- Commercial banks are those that take deposits and make loans. Commercial banks include retail banks, which primarily serve individuals and small businesses, and wholesale banks, which primarily serve corporate and institutional customers.
- Investment banks are those that assist in raising capital for their customers (e.g., by managing the issuance of debt and equity securities) and advising them on corporate finance matters such as mergers and restructurings.

#### LO 31.1: Identify the major risks faced by a bank.
- The main risks faced by a bank include credit risk, market risk, and operational risk.

#### LO 31.2: Distinguish between economic capital and regulatory capital.
- To mitigate the risk of bank failures caused by losses on loans or trading assets, banks must be funded by adequate sources of capital.
- Regulatory capital refers to the amount determined by bank regulators. In terms of bank regulation, equity is referred to as “Tier 1 capital” and subordinated long-term debt is referred to as “Tier 2 capital.”
- Economic capital refers to the amount of capital that a bank believes is adequate based on its own risk models.

#### LO 31.3: Explain how deposit insurance gives rise to a moral hazard problem.
- To increase public confidence in the banking system and prevent runs on banks, most countries have established systems of deposit insurance.
- Moral hazard is the observed phenomenon that insured parties take greater risks than they would normally take if they were not insured.
- One way of mitigating moral hazard is by making insurance premiums risk-based.

#### LO 31.4: Describe investment banking financing arrangements including private placement, public offering, best efforts, firm commitment, and Dutch auction approaches.
- In a **private placement**, securities are sold directly to qualified investors with substantial wealth and investment knowledge.
  - fee income
- If the securities are sold to the investing public at large, the issuance is referred to as a **public offering**.
  - With a **firm commitment**, the investment bank agrees to purchase the entire issue at a price that is negotiated between the issuer and bank.
    - spread
  - An investment bank can also agree to distribute an issue on a **best efforts** basis rather than agreeing to purchase the whole issue.
- First-time issues of stock by firms whose shares are not currently publicly traded are called initial public offerings (IPOs).
- Dutch auction begins with a price greater than what any bidder will pay, and this price is reduced until a bidder agrees to pay it.
  - Each bidder may specify how many units they will purchase when accepting a price.
  - The price continues to be reduced until bidders have accepted all the shares. 
  - The price at which the last of the shares can be sold becomes the price paid by all successful bidders.


#### LO 31.5: Describe the potential conflicts of interest among commercial banking, securities services, and investment banking divisions o f a bank and recommend solutions to the conflict o f interest problems.
- securiteis services pressure from IB
- material nonpublic information.

#### LO 31.6: Describe the distinctions between the “banking book” and the “trading book” o f a bank.

- The banking book refers to loans made, which are the primary assets of a commercial bank.
- a nonperforming loan the value does not include accrued interest. 
  - A loan is typically classified as nonperforming if payments are more than 90 days overdue.

- The trading book refers to assets and liabilities related to a bank’s trading activities.
  - marked to market daily
  - marked to model


#### LO 31.7: Explain the originate-to-distribute model of a bank and discuss its benefits and drawbacks.
- In contrast to a bank making loans and keeping them as assets, the originate-to-distribute model involves making loans and selling them to other parties.
  - freeing up capital
  - increase liquidity in sectors of the loan market
  - led banks to loosen lending standards


#### LO 32.1: Describe the key features o f the various categories o f insurance companies and identify the risks facing insurance companies.

- Three categories of insurance companies include life insurance, property and casualty (nonlife) insurance, and health insurance.
- term and whole life insurance
- Property insurance covers property losses such as fire and theft.

- Casualty (liability) insurance covers third-party liability for injuries sustained while on a policyholder’s premises or caused by the policyholder’s use of a vehicle
  - Liability insurance is subject to long-tail risk

- Major risks facing insurance companies
  - Insufficient funds to satisfy policyholders’ claims
  - Poor return on investments
  - Liquidity risk o f investments
  - Credit risk
  - Operational risk


#### LO 32.2: Describe the use o f mortality tables and calculate the premium payment for a policy holder.

- When examining the full table, the probability of death during the following year is a decreasing function of age until age 10 and then it increases.

- With the information in the mortality tables, we can calculate the breakeven premium payment by equating the present value of the expected payout to the present value of the expected premium payments


#### LO 32.3: Calculate and interpret loss ratio, expense ratio, combined ratio, and operating ratio for a property-casualty insurance company.

- The loss ratio for a given year is the percentage of payouts versus premiums generated, usually between 60—80% and increasing over time.
- The expense ratio for a given year is the percentage of expenses versus premiums generated, usually between 23—30% and decreasing over time. The largest expenses are usually loss adjustments (e.g., claims investigation and assessing payout amounts) and selling (e.g., broker commissions).
- The combined ratio for a given year is equal to the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio.
- The combined ratio after dividends for a given year is equal to the combined ratio plus the payment of dividends to policyholders (if applicable).
- The operating ratio for a given year is the combined ratio (after dividends) less
investment income.


#### LO 32.4: Describe moral hazard and adverse selection risks facing insurance companies, provide examples o f each, and describe how to overcome the problems.

- Moral hazard describes the risk to the insurance company that having insurance will lead the policyholder to act more recklessly than if the policyholder did not have insurance.
- Methods to mitigate against moral hazard include: deductibles (e.g., policyholder is responsible for a fixed amount of the loss), coinsurance provisions (e.g., insurance company will pay a fixed percentage of losses, less than 100%, over the deductible amount), and policy limits (e.g., fixed maximum payout).

- Adverse selection describes the situation where an insurer is unable to differentiate between a good risk and a bad risk.
- Methods to mitigate against adverse selection include: (1) greater initial due diligence (e.g., mandatory physical examinations for life insurance, researching driving records for automobile insurance) and (2) ongoing due diligence (e.g., updating driving records and adjusting premiums to reflect changing risk).

## LO 32.5: Distinguish between mortality risk and longevity risk and describe how to hedge these risks.

- Mortality risk refers to the risk of policyholders dying earlier than expected due to illness or disease, for example.
- Longevity risk refers to the risk of policyholders living longer than expected due to better healthcare and healthier lifestyle choices, for example
- There is a natural hedge (or offset) for insurance companies that deal with both life insurance products and annuity products.
  - longevity risk good for the life insurance
  - Mortality risk is good for the annuity business

- To the extent that there is excessive net exposure to mortality risk, longevity risk, or both, an insurance company may consider reinsurance contracts.

## LO 32.6: Evaluate the capital requirements for life insurance and property-casualty insurance companies. 
- life insurance
  - Assets: investments (80%), other assets (20%)
  - Liabilities and Equity: policy reserves (85%), subordinated long-term debt (5%), equity capital (10%)
- A P&C insurance company
  - Assets: investments (80%), other assets (20%)
  - Liabilities and Equity: policy reserves (50%), unearned premiums (10%), subordinated long-term debt (5%), equity capital (35%)
- Under an asset-liability management approach, the life insurance company attempts to equate asset duration with liability duration.
- For P&C insurance companies, assets typically comprise of highly liquid bonds with shorter maturities than those used by life insurance companies.
#### LO 32.7: Compare the guaranty system and the regulatory requirements for insurance companies with those for banks.
- In the United States, a guaranty system exists for both insurance companies and banks. Insurance companies are regulated at the state level while banks are regulated at the federal level.
- insurance companies must make contributions whenever a default occurs.
- the guaranty system for banks is a permanent fund to protect depositors and consists of amounts remitted by banks to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

#### LO 32.8: Describe a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan for a pension fund and explain the differences between them.
- Defined benefit plans (i.e., employee benefit known, employer contribution unknown) explicitly state the amount of the pension that the employee will receive upon retirement.

- Defined contribution plans (i.e., employer contribution known, employee benefit unknown) involve both employer and employee contributions being invested in one or more investment options selected by the employee.


- Liability insurance is subject to long-tail risk, which is the risk of legitimate claims being submitted years after the insurance coverage has ended.
