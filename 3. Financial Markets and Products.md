- Commercial banks are those that take deposits and make loans. Commercial banks include retail banks, which primarily serve individuals and small businesses, and wholesale banks, which primarily serve corporate and institutional customers.
- Investment banks are those that assist in raising capital for their customers (e.g., by managing the issuance of debt and equity securities) and advising them on corporate finance matters such as mergers and restructurings.

#### LO 31.1: Identify the major risks faced by a bank.
- The main risks faced by a bank include credit risk, market risk, and operational risk.

#### LO 31.2: Distinguish between economic capital and regulatory capital.
- To mitigate the risk of bank failures caused by losses on loans or trading assets, banks must be funded by adequate sources of capital.
- Regulatory capital refers to the amount determined by bank regulators. In terms of bank regulation, equity is referred to as “Tier 1 capital” and subordinated long-term debt is referred to as “Tier 2 capital.”
- Economic capital refers to the amount of capital that a bank believes is adequate based on its own risk models.

#### LO 31.3: Explain how deposit insurance gives rise to a moral hazard problem.
- To increase public confidence in the banking system and prevent runs on banks, most countries have established systems of deposit insurance.
- Moral hazard is the observed phenomenon that insured parties take greater risks than they would normally take if they were not insured.
- One way of mitigating moral hazard is by making insurance premiums risk-based.

#### LO 31.4: Describe investment banking financing arrangements including private placement, public offering, best efforts, firm commitment, and Dutch auction approaches.
- In a **private placement**, securities are sold directly to qualified investors with substantial wealth and investment knowledge.
  - fee income
- If the securities are sold to the investing public at large, the issuance is referred to as a **public offering**.
  - With a **firm commitment**, the investment bank agrees to purchase the entire issue at a price that is negotiated between the issuer and bank.
    - spread
  - An investment bank can also agree to distribute an issue on a **best efforts** basis rather than agreeing to purchase the whole issue.
- First-time issues of stock by firms whose shares are not currently publicly traded are called initial public offerings (IPOs).
- Dutch auction begins with a price greater than what any bidder will pay, and this price is reduced until a bidder agrees to pay it.
  - Each bidder may specify how many units they will purchase when accepting a price.
  - The price continues to be reduced until bidders have accepted all the shares. 
  - The price at which the last of the shares can be sold becomes the price paid by all successful bidders.


#### LO 31.5: Describe the potential conflicts of interest among commercial banking, securities services, and investment banking divisions o f a bank and recommend solutions to the conflict o f interest problems.
- securiteis services pressure from IB
- material nonpublic information.
- Chinese walls

#### LO 31.6: Describe the distinctions between the “banking book” and the “trading book” o f a bank.

- The banking book refers to loans made, which are the primary assets of a commercial bank.
- a nonperforming loan the value does not include accrued interest. 
  - A loan is typically classified as nonperforming if payments are more than 90 days overdue.

- The trading book refers to assets and liabilities related to a bank’s trading activities.
  - marked to market daily
  - marked to model


#### LO 31.7: Explain the originate-to-distribute model of a bank and discuss its benefits and drawbacks.
- In contrast to a bank making loans and keeping them as assets, the originate-to-distribute model involves making loans and selling them to other parties.
  - freeing up capital
  - increase liquidity in sectors of the loan market
  - led banks to loosen lending standards


#### LO 32.1: Describe the key features o f the various categories o f insurance companies and identify the risks facing insurance companies.

- Three categories of insurance companies include life insurance, property and casualty (nonlife) insurance, and health insurance.
- term and whole life insurance
- Property insurance covers property losses such as fire and theft.

- Casualty (liability) insurance covers third-party liability for injuries sustained while on a policyholder’s premises or caused by the policyholder’s use of a vehicle
  - Liability insurance is subject to long-tail risk

- Major risks facing insurance companies
  - Insufficient funds to satisfy policyholders’ claims
  - Poor return on investments
  - Liquidity risk o f investments
  - Credit risk
  - Operational risk


#### LO 32.2: Describe the use o f mortality tables and calculate the premium payment for a policy holder.

- When examining the full table, the probability of death during the following year is a decreasing function of age until age 10 and then it increases.

- With the information in the mortality tables, we can calculate the breakeven premium payment by equating the present value of the expected payout to the present value of the expected premium payments


#### LO 32.3: Calculate and interpret loss ratio, expense ratio, combined ratio, and operating ratio for a property-casualty insurance company.

- The loss ratio for a given year is the percentage of payouts versus premiums generated, usually between 60—80% and increasing over time.
- The expense ratio for a given year is the percentage of expenses versus premiums generated, usually between 23—30% and decreasing over time. The largest expenses are usually loss adjustments (e.g., claims investigation and assessing payout amounts) and selling (e.g., broker commissions).
- The combined ratio for a given year is equal to the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio.
- The combined ratio after dividends for a given year is equal to the combined ratio plus the payment of dividends to policyholders (if applicable).
- The operating ratio for a given year is the combined ratio (after dividends) less
investment income.


#### LO 32.4: Describe moral hazard and adverse selection risks facing insurance companies, provide examples o f each, and describe how to overcome the problems.

- Moral hazard describes the risk to the insurance company that having insurance will lead the policyholder to act more recklessly than if the policyholder did not have insurance.
- Methods to mitigate against moral hazard include: deductibles (e.g., policyholder is responsible for a fixed amount of the loss), coinsurance provisions (e.g., insurance company will pay a fixed percentage of losses, less than 100%, over the deductible amount), and policy limits (e.g., fixed maximum payout).

- Adverse selection describes the situation where an insurer is unable to differentiate between a good risk and a bad risk.
- Methods to mitigate against adverse selection include: (1) greater initial due diligence (e.g., mandatory physical examinations for life insurance, researching driving records for automobile insurance) and (2) ongoing due diligence (e.g., updating driving records and adjusting premiums to reflect changing risk).

## LO 32.5: Distinguish between mortality risk and longevity risk and describe how to hedge these risks.

- Mortality risk refers to the risk of policyholders dying earlier than expected due to illness or disease, for example.
- Longevity risk refers to the risk of policyholders living longer than expected due to better healthcare and healthier lifestyle choices, for example
- There is a natural hedge (or offset) for insurance companies that deal with both life insurance products and annuity products.
  - longevity risk good for the life insurance
  - Mortality risk is good for the annuity business

- To the extent that there is excessive net exposure to mortality risk, longevity risk, or both, an insurance company may consider reinsurance contracts.

## LO 32.6: Evaluate the capital requirements for life insurance and property-casualty insurance companies. 
- life insurance
  - Assets: investments (80%), other assets (20%)
  - Liabilities and Equity: policy reserves (85%), subordinated long-term debt (5%), equity capital (10%)
- A P&C insurance company
  - Assets: investments (80%), other assets (20%)
  - Liabilities and Equity: policy reserves (50%), unearned premiums (10%), subordinated long-term debt (5%), equity capital (35%)
- Under an asset-liability management approach, the life insurance company attempts to equate asset duration with liability duration.
- For P&C insurance companies, assets typically comprise of highly liquid bonds with shorter maturities than those used by life insurance companies.
#### LO 32.7: Compare the guaranty system and the regulatory requirements for insurance companies with those for banks.
- In the United States, a guaranty system exists for both insurance companies and banks. Insurance companies are regulated at the state level while banks are regulated at the federal level.
- insurance companies must make contributions whenever a default occurs.
- the guaranty system for banks is a permanent fund to protect depositors and consists of amounts remitted by banks to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

#### LO 32.8: Describe a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan for a pension fund and explain the differences between them.
- Defined benefit plans (i.e., employee benefit known, employer contribution unknown) explicitly state the amount of the pension that the employee will receive upon retirement.

- Defined contribution plans (i.e., employer contribution known, employee benefit unknown) involve both employer and employee contributions being invested in one or more investment options selected by the employee.


- Liability insurance is subject to long-tail risk, which is the risk of legitimate claims being submitted years after the insurance coverage has ended.


#### LO 33.1: Differentiate among open-end mutual funds, closed-end mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
- Mutual funds are pooled investment vehicles that offer instant diversification for their investors.
- Open-end mutual funds, which are often simply called mutual funds, are the most common pooled investment vehicle
  - broken down into four main categories: money market funds, equity funds, bond funds, and hybrid funds
  - Open-end funds trade at the fund’s net asset value (NAV), which is essentially the sum of all assets owned minus any liabilities of the fund then divided by the shares outstanding.
  - poor price visibility
- Sales charges are commonly called loads. A front-end load is a set percentage that is charged to the investor when the asset is originally sold. Alternatively, some funds choose to charge a sales charge if an investor leaves a fund within a certain window of time. This is called a back-end load.


- The first difference is that closed-end funds tend to invest in niche areas like specific emerging markets, while open-end mutual funds tend to invest in broader areas like a diversified emerging markets fund.
- The second difference is that a purchase of shares in an open-end mutual fund will increase the number of shares outstanding because new shares are created, but a closed-end fund’s number of shares remains static.
  - Investors who desire to purchase shares of a closed-end fund do not transact direcdy with the fund company but rather with other investors.
- It is very common for a closed-end fund to trade at either a discount or a premium to its actual NAV.
- Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent an innovative twist on the open-end mutual fund.
  - exchange-traded
  - vast majority of ETFs are passively managed index funds

- They are all regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and must register with the SEC and provide a very detailed disclosure document, called a prospectus, to all investors prior to investing.

#### LO 33.2: Calculate the net asset value (NAY) of an open-end mutual fund.
- NAV = (fund assets — fund liabilities) / total shares outstanding

#### LO 33.3: Explain the key differences between hedge funds and mutual funds.

- Hedge funds are also permitted to use leverage while mutual funds are not.
  - advance notification. 90d
  - lock-up period
  - illiquid

#### LO 33.4: Calculate the return on a hedge fund investment and explain the incentive fee structure of a hedge fund including the terms hurdle rate, high-water mark, and clawback.
- These incentive fees are engineered to give hedge fund managers significant payouts based on their performance. The typical hedge fund fee structure is known as “2 plus 20%,”
  - The first safeguard is the hurdle rate, which is the benchmark that must be beaten before incentive fees can be charged\
  - The second safeguard is a high-water mark clause, which essentially states that previous losses must first be recouped and hurdle rates surpassed before incentive fees once again apply.

  - The third safeguard for investors is a clawback clause, which enables investors to retain a portion of previously paid incentive fees in an escrow account that is used to offset investment losses should they occur.
  - encouraging fund managers to take risks

- LO 33.5: Describe various hedge fund strategies, including long/short equity, dedicated short, distressed securities, merger arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, fixed income arbitrage, emerging markets, global macro, and managed fixtures, and identify the risks faced by hedge funds.

- Long/short equity hedge funds endeavor to find mispriced securities.
  - fundamental analysis
  - sector neutral, Market neutralfunds, factor neutral funds
- Dedicated short hedge funds are focused exclusively on finding a company that they think is overvalued and then short selling the stock.

- Bonds with a credit rating of BB or less are considered to be “junk” bonds, while those with a CCC rating are considered to be “distressed.”
  - passively wait, active approach to influencing
- Merger arbitrage hedge funds try to find arbitrage opportunities after mergers are announced.
  - cash deals and stock deals.
  - great potential for insider trading issues.
- Fixed income arbitrage hedge funds attempt to exploit perceived mispricings in the realm of fixed-income securities.
  - picking up nickels in front of a steamroller.

- Emerging market hedge funds focus on investments in developing countries.
  - American depository receipts (ADRs)
- hedge fund managers attempt to profit from a global macroeconomic trend that they feel is not in equilibrium (priced correctly and rationally).

- Managed futures hedge funds attempt to predict future movements in commodity prices based on either technical analysis or fundamental analysis.

#### LO 33.6: Describe hedge fund performance and explain the effect o f measurement biases on performance measurement.

- measurement bias of hedge fund index reporting
- When returns are reported by a hedge fund, the database is then backfilled with the fund’s previous returns.
- Protection during periods of stock market volatility is one hallmark of hedge funds as they actively pursue short selling when traditional mutual funds are not allowed to do so.


- Open-end mutual funds can only be bought or sold using a market order. Closed-end funds can be bought or sold using stop orders and limit orders. In some cases, ETFs can be sold short.

- An open outcry system and electronic trading system are different forms of trading securities (matching buyers with sellers). The open outcry system (e.g., CBOT) is the more traditional system, which involves traders actually indicating their trades through hand signals and shouting.

#### LO 34.1: Describe the over-the-counter market, distinguish it from trading on an exchange, and evaluate its advantages and disadvantages.
- Terms are not set by any exchange.
- negotiate
- calls are recorded
- more credit risk
#### LO 34.2: Differentiate between options, forwards, and futures contracts.

- A forward contract is a contract that specifies the price and quantity of an asset to be delivered sometime in the future.
- A futures contract is a more formalized, legally binding agreement to buy/sell a commodity/ financial instrument in a pre-designated month in the future, at a price agreed upon today by the buyer/seller.

#### LO 34.3: Identify and calculate option and forward contract payoffs.

- The price paid for the call option, CQ, is referred to as the call premium.

#### LO 34.4: Calculate and compare the payoffs from hedging strategies involving forward contracts and options.

- Hedgers use forward contracts and options to reduce or eliminate financial exposure.


#### LO 34.5: Calculate and compare the payoffs from speculative strategies involving futures and options.
- Speculators use derivatives to make bets on the market, while hedgers try to eliminate exposures.


#### LO 34.6: Calculate an arbitrage payoff and describe how arbitrage opportunities are temporary.
- Arbitrageurs are also frequent users of derivatives.

#### LO 34.7: Describe some of the risks that can arise from the use o f derivatives.



#### LO 35.1: Define and describe the key features of a futures contract, including the asset, the contract price and size, delivery, and limits.
#### LO 35.9: Compare and contrast forward and futures contracts.
- Most futures positions are not held to take delivery of the underlying good. Instead, they are closed out or reversed prior to the settlement date.
- Open interest is the total number of long positions in a given futures contract.

- Futures contract characteristics
  - Quality o f the underlying asset. Contract size.
  - Delivery location. Delivery time.
  - Price quotations and tick size. Daily price limits(limit down/up). Position limits.


#### LO 35.2: Explain the convergence of futures and spot prices.

- The basis is the difference between the spot price and the futures price.

#### LO 35.3: Describe the rationale for margin requirements and explain how they work.
- Margin is cash or highly liquid collateral placed in an account to ensure that any trading losses will be met.
- The amount required to open a futures position is called the initial margin. The maintenance margin is the minimum margin account balance required to retain the futures position.
- gets a margin call, and he must bring the margin account back to the initial margin amount. The amount necessary to do this is called the variation margin.


#### LO 35.4: Describe the role of a clearinghouse in futures and over-the-counter market transactions.


#### LO 35-5: Describe the role of collateralization in the over-the-counter market and compare it to the margining system.

#### LO 35.6: Identify the differences between a normal and inverted futures market.
- The settlement price is analogous to the closing price for a stock but is not simply the price of the last trade. It is an average of the prices of the trades during the last period of trading, called the closing period, which is set by the exchange.
- Increasing settlement prices over time indicates a normal market. Conversely, decreasing settlement prices over time indicates an inverted market

#### LO 35.7: Describe the mechanics o f the delivery process and contrast it with cash settlement.

#### LO 35.8: Evaluate the impact of different trading order types.

- A limit buy order is placed below the current price. A limit sell order is placed above the current price.

- Stop-limit orders: once the stop level is reached, or bettered, the order would turn into a limit order and hopefully transact at the limit price. 
- Market-if-touched orders, or MIT orders, are orders that would become market orders once a specified price is reached in the marketplace.

- Another difference is that capital losses are deductible for non-corporate taxpayers.
- Gains/losses on hedging transactions are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income.

- Determining which contracts will trade is a function of the exchange, not the clearinghouse.

#### LO 36.1: Define and differentiate between short and long hedges and identify their appropriate uses.


#### LO 36.2: Describe the arguments for and against hedging and the potential impact o f hedging on firm profitability.
- anticipatory hedge is an example of a long hedge, where the user locks in a future purchasing price.

#### LO 36.3: Define the basis and explain the various sources o f basis risk, and explain how basis risks arise when hedging with futures.
#### LO 36.4: Define cross hedging, and compute and interpret the minimum variance hedge ratio and hedge effectiveness.

- (1) the asset in the existing position is often not the same as that underlying the futures, and (2) the hedging horizon may not match perfectly with the maturity of the futures contract. The existence of either one of these conditions leads to what is called basis risk.
- basis is also sometimes defined as: futures price minus spot price, mostly when dealing with financial asset futures.

- Three sources of basis risk are: (1) interruption in the convergence of the futures and spot prices, (2) changes in the cost of carry, and (3) imperfect matching between the cash asset and the hedge asset.
- A hedge ratio is the ratio of the size of the futures position relative to the spot position. The optimal hedge ratio, which minimizes the variance of the combined hedge position

- HR = the correlation between the spot prices and the futures prices X (the standard deviation of the spot price/the standard deviation of the futures price) = the beta of spot prices with respect to futures contract prices

- The R^2 is the square of the correlation coefficient (p2) between spot and futures prices.

#### LO 36.5: Compute the optimal number of futures contracts needed to hedge an exposure, and explain and calculate the “tailing the hedge” adjustment.
- it is important to remember that the hedged portfolio’s beta serves as a hedge ratio when determining the correct number of contracts to purchase or sell.

- To correct for the possibility o f over-hedging, a hedger can implement a tailing the hedge strategy. The extra step needed to carry out this strategy is to multiply the hedge ratio by the daily spot price to futures price ratio.


#### LO 36.6: Explain how to use stock index futures contracts to change a stock portfolio s beta.

- number of contracts = (Beta* - Beta)X(P/A)
#### LO 36.7: Explain the term “rolling the hedge forward” and describe some o f the risks that arise from this strategy.
- rollover basis risk, or simply rollover risk


#### LO 37.1: Describe Treasury rates, LIBOR, and repo rates, and explain what is meant by the “risk-free” rate. *

- Treasury rates. Treasury rates are the rates that correspond to government borrowing in its own currency. They are considered risk-free rates.
- LIBOR. The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is the rate at which large international banks fund their activities.
- Repo rates. The “repo” or repurchase agreement rate is the implied rate on a repurchase agreement.

- an inverse floater is a debt instrument whose coupon payments fluctuate inversely with the reference rate (e.g., LIBOR).

#### LO 37.2: Calculate the value o f an investment using different compounding frequencies.
#### LO 37.3: Convert interest rates based on different compounding frequencies.

Rc = m\*ln(1 + R/m)

#### LO 37.4: Calculate the theoretical price o f a bond using spot rates.

- Spot rates are the rates that correspond to zero-coupon bond yields.
  - They are the appropriate discount rates for a single cash flow at a particular future time or maturity. 
  - Spot rates are also often called zero rates.

- The yield of a bond is the single discount rate that equates the present value of a bond to its market price.

- The bond’s par yield is the rate which makes the price of a bond equal to its par value.

- The theoretical spot curve is derived by interpreting each Treasury bond (T-bond) as a package of zero-coupon bonds. Using the prices for each bond, the spot curve is computed using the bootstrapping methodology.


#### LO 37.5: Derive forward interest rates from a set o f spot rates.

- Forward rates are interest rates implied by the spot curve for a specified future period.

#### LO 37.6: Derive the value o f the cash flows from a forward rate agreement (FRA).

- A forward rate agreement (FRA) is a forward contract obligating two parties to agree that a certain interest rate will apply to a principal amount during a specified future time.


#### LO 37.7: Calculate the duration, modified duration and dollar duration o f a bond.

- The duration of a bond is the average time until the cash flows on the bond are received.
- The duration of a bond is the average time until the cash flows on the bond are received.

- Modified duration is used when the yield given is something other than a continuously compounded rate.
- Dollar duration is simply modified duration multiplied by the price of the bond.


#### LO 37.8: Evaluate the limitations of duration and explain how convexity addresses some o f them.
- Duration is a good approximation of price changes for an option-free bond, but it’s only good for relatively small changes in interest rates.
- all convexity does is account for the amount of error in the estimated price change based on duration.
- for an option-free bond, the convexity effect is always positive, no matter which direction interest rates move.

- diff(B)/B = - duration\*diff(Y)

#### LO 37.9: Calculate the change in a bond’s price given its duration, its convexity, and a change in interest rates.

-   convexity effect = 0.5\*convexity\*diff(Y^2)

#### LO 37.10: Compare and contrast the major theories of the term structure of interest rates.

- The expectations theory suggests that forward rates correspond to expected future spot rates.
- The market segmentation theory states that the bond market is segmented into different maturity sectors and that supply and demand for bonds in each maturity range dictate rates in that maturity range.

- The liquidity preference theory suggests that most depositors prefer shortterm liquid deposits.


#### LO 38.1: Differentiate between investment and consumption assets.

- Examples of consumption assets include commodities such as oil and natural gas.

#### LO 38.2: Define short-selling and calculate the net profit o f a short sale of a dividend-paying stock.

- The short seller may be forced to close his position if the broker runs out of securities to borrow. This is known as a short squeeze, and the seller will need to close his short position immediately.
  - 1. The short seller must pay all dividends due to the lender o f the security.
  - 2. The short seller must deposit collateral to guarantee the eventual repurchase of the security.


#### LO 38.3: Describe the differences between forward and futures contracts and explain the relationship between forward and spot prices.
#### LO 38.4: Calculate the forward price given the underlying assets spot price, and describe an arbitrage argument between spot and forward prices.
#### LO 38.9: Calculate, using the cost-of-carry model, forward prices where the underlying asset either does or does not have interim cash flows.


#### LO 38.6: Calculate a forward foreign exchange rate using the interest rate parity relationship.
- Interest rate parity (IRP) states that the forward exchange rate, F (measured in domestic per unit of foreign currency), must be related to the spot exchange rate, S, and to the interest rate differential between the domestic and the foreign country, r — rf.

#### LO 38.5: Explain the relationship between forward and futures prices.

- The most significant difference between forward contracts and futures contracts is the daily marking to market requirement on futures contracts.


#### LO 38.7: Define income, storage costs, and convenience yield.
#### LO 38.8: Calculate the futures price on commodities incorporating income/storage costs and/or convenience yields.

- Consumption assets have actual storage costs associated with them.

- the convenience yield is simply the yield required to produce an equality and is thus a measure of the benefit of owning spot, or physical, consumption commodities.


#### LO 38.10: Describe the various delivery options available in the futures markets and how they can influence futures prices.


#### LO 38.11: Explain the relationship between current futures prices and expected future spot prices, including the impact o f systematic and nonsystematic risk.

- expectations model tates that the current futures price for delivery at time T is equal to the expected spot price at time T.

#### LO 38.12: Define and interpret contango and backwardation, and explain how they relate to the cost-of-carry model.

- Backwardation refers to a situation where the futures price is below the current spot price. For this to occur, there must be a significant benefit to holding the asset.

- Contango refers to a situation where the futures price is above the current spot price. If there are no benefits to holding the asset


#### LO 39.1: Identify the most commonly used day count conventions, describe the markets that each one is typically used in, and apply each to an interest calculation.

- 1. U.S. Treasury bonds use actual/actual.
- 2. U.S. corporate and municipal bonds use 30/360.
- 3. U.S. money market instruments (Treasury bills) use actual/360.


#### LO 39.3: Differentiate between the clean and dirty price for a US Treasury bond; calculate the accrued interest and dirty price on a US Treasury bond.

- T-bond prices are quoted relative to a $100 par amount in dollars and 32nds.
- The cash price (a.k.a. invoice price or dirty price) is the price that the seller of the bond must be paid to give up ownership. It includes the present value of the bond (a.k.a. quoted price or clean price) plus the accrued interest.

#### LO 39.2: Calculate the conversion o f a discount rate to a price for a US Treasury bill.

- T-bill discount rate = 360/n * (100 — Y)

#### LO 39.4: Explain and calculate a US Treasury bond futures contract conversion factor.
#### LO 39.3: Calculate the cost of delivering a bond into a Treasury bond futures contract.
#### LO 39.6: Describe the impact of the level and shape o f the yield curve on the cheapest-to-deliver Treasury bond decision.

- The CTD bond minimizes the following: quoted bond price - (QFP x CF).

- When yields > 6%, CTD bonds tend to be low-coupon, long-maturity bonds.
- When yields < 6%, CTD bonds tend to be high-coupon, short-maturity bonds.
- When the yield curve is upward sloping, CTD bonds tend to have longer maturities.
- When the yield curve is downward sloping, CTD bonds tend to have shorter maturities.


#### LO 39.7: Calculate the theoretical futures price for a Treasury bond futures contract.


#### LO 3 9 .8 : Calculate the final contract price on a Eurodollar fixtures contract.
#### LO 39.9: Describe and compute the Eurodollar fixtures contract convexity adjustment.

- The 3-month eurodollar fixtures contract trades on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and is the most popular interest rate futures in the United States.
- This contract settles in cash and the minimum price change is one “tick,” which is a price change of one basis point, or $23 per $ 1 million contract. Eurodollar futures are based on a eurodollar deposit (a eurodollar is a U.S. dollar deposited outside the United States) with a face amount of $ 1 million. 
- The interest rate underlying this contract is essentially the 3-month (90-day) forward LIBOR.

#### LO 39.10: Explain how Eurodollar futures can be used to extend the LIBOR zero curve.

- Forward rates implied by convexity-adjusted eurodollar futures can be used to produce a LIBOR spot curve (also called a LIBOR zero curve since spot rates are sometimes referred to as zero rates).

#### LO 39.11: Calculate the duration-based hedge ratio and create a duration-based hedging strategy using interest rate futures.

- The objective of a duration-based hedge is to create a combined position that does not change in value when yields change by a small amount. In other words, a position that has a duration of zero needs to be produced.


#### LO 39.12: Explain the limitations o f using a duration-based hedging strategy.

- duration implies that all yields are perfectly correlated

#### LO 40.1: Explain the mechanics o f a plain vanilla interest rate swap and compute its cash flows.

- The first cash flow takes place at the end of period one and uses the LIBOR at the beginning of that same period.

#### LO 40.2: Explain how a plain vanilla interest rate swap can be used to transform an asset or a liability and calculate the resulting cash flows.


#### LO 40.3: Explain the role of financial intermediaries in the swaps market.
#### LO 40.4: Describe the role of the confirmation in a swap transaction.

- Financial intermediaries, such as banks, will typically earn a spread of about 3 to 4 basis points for bringing two nonfinancial companies together in a swap agreement.
- If one of the parties defaults on its swap payments, the intermediary is responsible for making the other party whole.

- Confirmations, as drafted by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), outline the details of each swap agreement.


#### LO 40.5: Describe the comparative advantage argument for the existence of interest rate swaps and evaluate some o f the criticisms o f this argument.

- credit risk
- intermediary

#### LO 40.6: Explain how the discount rates in a plain vanilla interest rate swap are computed.

- It turns out that the forward rates implied by either forward rate agreements (FRAs) or the convexity-adjusted Eurodollar futures are used to produce a LIBOR spot curve.

#### LO 40.7: Calculate the value of a plain vanilla interest rate swap based on two simultaneous bond positions.

#### LO 40.8: Calculate the value of a plain vanilla interest rate swap from a sequence o f forward rate agreements (FRAs).
- One way to value a swap would be to use expected forward rates to forecast the expected net cash flows and then discount these expected cash flows at the corresponding spot rates, consistent with forward rate expectations.

#### LO 40.9: Explain the mechanics o f a currency swap and compute its cash flows.
#### LO 40.11: Calculate the value of a currency swap based on two simultaneous bond positions.

- A currency swap exchanges both principal and interest rate payments with payments in different currencies.
- The exchange rate used in currency swaps is the spot exchange rate.

#### LO 40.12: Calculate the value of a currency swap based on a sequence o f FRAs.

#### LO 40.10: Explain how a currency swap can be used to transform an asset or liability and calculate the resulting cash flows.

#### LO 40.13: Describe the credit risk exposure in a swap position.

- A swaption is an option which gives the holder the right to enter into an interest rate swap.

#### LO 41.1: Describe the types, position variations, and typical underlying assets o f options.

- Note that the unit size for currency options is considerably larger than stock options (i.e., 1 million units for yen and 10,000 units for other currencies).
- Options on stock indices are typically European-style options and are cash settled.

- American-styie, exchange-traded options are most often utilized for futures contracts. Typically, the futures option expiration date is set to a date shortly before the expiration date of the futures contract. The market value o f the underlying asset for futures options is the value of the underlying futures contract.


#### LO 41.2: Explain the specification o f exchange-traded stock option contracts, including that o f nonstandard products.

- Long-term equity anticipation securities (LEAPS®) are simply long-dated options with expirations greater than one year. All LEAPS have January expirations.

- An option class refers to all options o f the same type, whether calls or puts. An option series refers to an option class with the same expiration.

- out of the money, at the money, in the money
- An option price (or premium) prior to expiration has two components: the time value and the intrinsic value.

- FLEX options. FLEX options are exchange-traded options on equity indices and equities that allow some alteration of the options contract specifications.

- Weekly options. Weeklys are short-term options that are created on a Thursday and have an expiration date on the Friday of the next week.

- Binary options. Binary options generate discontinuous payoff profiles because they pay only one price ($100) at expiration if the asset value is above the strike price.

- CEBOs. A CEBO is a specific form of credit default swap. CEBOs are European options that are cash settled.

- DOOM options. These put options are structured to only be in the money in the event of a large downward price movement in the underlying asset. structured as a put option.

- In general, if a stock experiences a b-for-a stock split, the strike price becomes (a/b) of its previous value and the number of shares underlying the option is increased by multiples o f b/a.
- In general, options are not adjusted for cash dividends.
- The number of options a trader can have on one stock is limited by the exchange. This is called a position limit.

#### LO 41.3: Describe how trading, commissions, margin requirements, and exercise typically work for exchange-traded options.

- The cost associated with this spread for options can be calculated by multiplying the spread by 50%.

- Naked options (or uncovered options) refers to options in which the writer does not also own a position in the underlying asset.

- Warrants are often issued by a company to make a bond issue more attractive and will typically trade separately from the bond at some point.


#### LO 42.1: Identify the six factors that affect an options price and describe how these six factors affect the price for both European and American options.

- For American-style options, increasing time to expiration will increase the option value.
- Volatility is the friend of all options.

#### LO 42.2: Identify and compute upper and lower bounds for option prices on nondividend and dividend paying stocks.


#### LO 42.3: Explain put-call parity and apply it to the valuation of European and American stock options.

- A fiduciary call is a combination of a pure-discount (i.e., zero coupon), riskless bond that pays X at maturity and a call with exercise price X.
- A protective put is a share of stock together with a put option on the stock.
- When working with put-call parity, it is important to note that the exercise prices on the put and the call and the face value o f the riskless bond are all equal to X.

- c + Xc^-rT = S + p
- Note that the options must be European-style and the puts and calls must have the same exercise price for these relations to hold.
 - put + stock = call + bond

#### LO 42.4: Explain the early exercise features o f American call and put options.

- Since exercising the American call early means that the investor would have to forgo this interest, it is never optimal to exercise an American call on a nondividend-paying stock before the expiration date

- American puts are optimally exercised early if they are sufficiently in-the-money.
- S0 - X <= C-P <= S0 - Xe^-rt

- All else equal, the payment of a dividend will reduce the lower pricing bound for a call option.
- All else equal, the payment of a dividend will increase the lower pricing bound for a put option.

- When the dividend is large enough(exceeds the amount of interest), American calls might be optimally exercised early.

#### LO 43.1: Explain the motivation to initiate a covered call or a protective put strategy.

- When an at-the-money long put position is combined with the underlying stock, we have created a protective put strategy.
- Another common strategy is to sell a call option on a stock that is owned by the option writer. This is called a covered call position.

#### LO 43.2: Describe the use and calculate the payoffs of various spread strategies.
- A bear call spread is the sale of a bull spread.
- In a bear put spread the investor buys a put with a higher exercise price and sells a put with a lower exercise price.

- A butterfly spread involves the purchase or sale of three different call options. Here, the investor buys one call with a low exercise price, buys another call with a high exercise price, and sells two calls with an exercise price in between. 
  - The buyer of a butterfly spread is essentially betting that the stock price will stay near the strike price of the written calls.
- The strategy is referred to as a neutral calendar spread if the strike price is close to the current stock price. A bullish calendar spread has a strike price above the current stock price, and a bearish calendar spread has a strike price below the current stock price.
- the options in a diagonal spread can have different strike prices in addition to different expirations.

- A box spread is a combination of a bull call spread and a bear put spread on the same asset. This strategy will produce a constant payoff that is equal to the high exercise price (XH) minus the low exercise price (XL). Under a no arbitrage assumption, the present value of the payoff will equal the net premium paid (i.e., profit will equal zero).
- Note that box spread arbitrage is only successful with European options.

#### LO 43.3: Describe the use and explain the payoff functions of combination strategies.
- A long straddle (bottom straddle or straddle purchase) is created by purchasing a call and a put with the same strike price and expiration.
  - This strategy bets on volatility.

- A short straddle (top straddle or straddle write) sells both options and bets on little movement in the stock.


- A strangle (or bottom vertical combination) is similar to a straddle except that the options purchased are slightly out-of-the-money
- A strip involves purchasing two puts and one call with the same strike price and expiration
- A strap involves purchasing two calls and one put with the same strike price and expiration.

- A collar is the combination of a protective put and covered call. The usual goal is for the owner of the underlying asset to buy a protective put and then sell a call to pay for the put. If the premiums of the two are equal, it is called a zero-cost collar.

- An interest rate cap is an agreement in which one party agrees to pay the other at regular intervals over a certain period of time when the benchmark interest rate (e.g., LIBOR) exceeds the strike rate specified in the contract. This strike rate is called the cap rate.
  - Because an interest rate cap is a multi-period agreement, a cap is actually a portfolio of call options on LIBOR called caplets

- An interest rate floor is an agreement in which one party agrees to pay the other at regular intervals over a certain time period when the benchmark interest rate (e.g., LIBOR) falls below the strike rate specified in the contract. This strike rate is called the floor rate.
  - floorlets.


#### LO 44.1: Define and contrast exotic derivatives and plain vanilla derivatives.
#### LO 44.2: Describe some of the factors that drive the development of exotic products. 

- Exotic derivatives are customized to fit a specific firm need for hedging that cannot be met by plain vanilla derivatives.


#### LO 44.3: Explain how any derivative can be converted into a zero-cost product.
- Because packages often consist of a long position and a short position, they can be constructed so that the initial cost to the investor is zero.

#### LO 44.4: Describe how standard American options can be transformed into nonstandard American options.

- The most common transformation can be made to restrict early exercise to certain dates.Bermudan option.
- Early exercise can be limited to a certain portion of the life of the option. there is a “lock out” period 
- The option’s strike price may change.

#### LO 44.5: Identify and describe the characteristics and pay-off structure of the following exotic options: gap, forward start, compound, chooser, barrier, binary, lookback, shout, Asian, exchange, rainbow, and basket options.

- A gap option has two strike prices, Xj and X^. (X2 is sometimes referred to as the trigger price.)
- Forward start options are options that begin their existence at some time in the future. Employee incentive plans
  - the value of a forward start option will be identical to the value of a European at-the-money option with the same time to expiration as the forward start option.
   
- Compound options are options on options.
  - Compound options consist of two strike prices and two exercise dates.
  
  
- Chooser option allows the owner, after a certain period of time has elapsed, to choose whether the option is a call or a put.

- Barrier options are options whose payoffs (and existence) depend on whether the underlying’s asset price reaches a certain barrier level over the life of the option.
  - knock-out or knock-in

- Note that the value of a down-and-out call combined with the value of a down-and-in call is equal to the value of a standard call option.

- Binary options generate discontinuous payoff profiles because they pay only one price at expiration if the asset value is above the strike price.

- Lookback options are options whose payoffs depend on the maximum or minimum price of the underlying asset during the life of the option.

- A floating lookback call pays the difference between the expiration price and the minimum price of the stock over the horizon of the option.
- a fixed lookback put has a payoff like a European put option but replaces the final stock price with the minimum price during the option’s life.

- A shout option allows the owner to pick a date when he “shouts” to the option seller, which then translates into an intrinsic value of the option at the time of the shout.
  - Note that most shout options allow for one “shout” during the option’s life.

- Asian options have payoff profiles based on the average price of the security over the life of the option. Average price calls and puts pay off the difference between the average stock price and the strike price.

- A common use of an option to exchange one asset for another, often called an exchange option, is to exchange one currency with another.
- Basket options are simply options to purchase or sell baskets of securities.
  - Any exotic options that involve several different assets are more generally referred to as rainbow options.

#### LO 44.6: Describe and contrast volatility and variance swaps.
- A volatility swap involves the exchange of volatility based on a notional principal.

- Much like a volatility swap, a variance swap involves exchanging a pre-specified fixed variance rate for a realized variance rate. The variance rate being exchanged is simply the square of the volatility rate.

#### LO 44.7: Explain the basic premise o f static option replication and how it can be applied to hedging exotic options.

- When the replication portfolio requires frequent adjustments to the holdings in the underlying assets, the hedging procedure is referred to as dynamic options replication.
- static options replication

- Vega is the sensitivity of the price of an option to changes in volatility of the underlying stock.

#### LO 45.1: Apply commodity concepts such as storage costs, carry markets, lease rate, and convenience yield.
#### LO 45.2: Explain the basic equilibrium formula for pricing commodity forwards.
#### LO 45.13: Explain how to create a synthetic commodity position, and use it to explain the relationship between the forward price and the expected future spot price.


- The prices of the commodity futures contracts will differ with the different contract expiration dates. The set of futures prices for a given commodity is known as a forward curve or a forward strip on that particular day.

- the forward price today is a biased estimate of the expected commodity spot price at time T.

#### LO 45.3: Describe an arbitrage transaction in commodity forwards, and compute the potential arbitrage profit.

- A cash-and-carry arbitrage consists of buying the commodity, storing/holding the commodity, and selling the commodity at the futures price when the contract expires.

#### LO 45.4: Define the lease rate and explain how it determines the no-arbitrage values for commodity forwards and futures.

- The lease rate in the pricing of a commodity forward is very similar to the dividend payment in a financial forward.

- risk-free rate less the lease rate
- The market is described as being in contango with an upward-sloping forward curve.
- The market is described as being in backwardation with a downward-sloping forward curve.


#### LO 45.5: Define carry markets, and illustrate the impact of storage costs and convenience yields on commodity forward prices and no-arbitrage bounds.
#### LO 45.6: Compute the forward price of a commodity with storage costs.

- When holding a commodity requires storage costs, the forward price must be greater than the spot price to compensate for the physical storage costs and financial storage costs (i.e., interest).
- The market in which a commodity is stored is referred to as a carry market

- Holding an excess amount of a commodity for a non-monetary return is referred to as convenience yield.

#### LO 45.7: Compare the lease rate with the convenience yield.


#### LO 45.8: Identify factors that impact gold, com, electricity, natural gas, and oil forward prices.

- Since arbitrage opportunities do not exist with electricity futures prices on electricity will vary much more during the trading day than financial futures.

#### LO 45.9: Compute a commodity spread.
- A commodity spread results from a commodity that is an input in the production process of other commodities.
- crush spread
- the difference in prices of crude oil, heating oil, and gasoline is known as a crack spread.
  - the amount of profit that can be locked in


#### LO 45.10: Explain how basis risk can occur when hedging commodity price exposure.

- basis is the difference between the spot price (or rate) and the price (or rate) of the futures contract used to hedge

#### LO 45.11: Evaluate the differences between a strip hedge and a stack hedge and explain how these differences impact risk management.
- strip hedge
- stack hedge strategy of continually rolling into the next near-term contract is referred to as stack and roll.

#### LO 45.12: Provide examples o f cross-hedging, specifically the process of hedging jet fuel with crude oil and using weather derivatives.


#### LO 46.1: Describe how exchanges can be used to alleviate counterparty risk.
- Exchange functions fall into three primary categories: product standardization, trading venue, and reporting services.

#### LO 46.2: Explain the developments in clearing that reduce risk.
- Clearing is the process of reconciling and matching contracts between counterparties from the time the commitments are made until settlement.
- Initial margin represents upfront funds posted to mitigate against counterparty default, while variation margin represents the daily transfer of funds (cash or other assets) to cover position gains and losses. Netting refers to consolidating multiple offsetting positions between counterparties into a single payment.

- Direct clearing is a mechanism for bilaterally reconciling commitments between two counterparties.
- A clearing ring is a mechanism to reduce counterparty exposure between three or more exchange members. A clearing ring is voluntary for exchange members
- Complete clearing refers to clearing through a central counterparty (CCP).

#### LO 46.3: Compare exchange-traded and OTC markets and describe their uses.


#### LO 46.4: Identify the classes o f derivatives securities and explain the risk associated with them.

- OTC derivatives comprise of five broad classes: interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity, and credit derivatives. Interest rate derivatives dominate the five classes and comprise nearly three quarters of the total gross notional outstanding.

- gross market value is often seen as a more useful measure for OTC derivatives, including the ratio of gross market value to gross notional value(3%).

#### LO 46.3: Identify risks associated with OTC markets and explain how these risks can be mitigated.

- Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs)
  - SPVs are bankruptcy remote legal entities set up by a parent firm to shield the SPV from any financial distress of the firm.
  - The primary benefit of using an SPV is to obtain a strong credit rating, typically AAA.
  - One of the main benefits of SPVs is that they alter bankruptcy rules and transform counterparty risk into legal risk.

- Derivatives Product Companies (DPCs)
  - DPCs are set up by firms as bankruptcy remote subsidiaries to originate derivatives products and sell them to investors.

- Monolines and Credit Derivative Product Companies (CDPCs)
  - Monolines are highly-rated insurance companies that provide financial guarantees, called “credit wraps” to investors.

- wrong-way risk (a risk that arises when the exposure to a counterparty is inversely related to the credit quality of the counterparty).


#### LO 47.1: Provide examples o f the mechanics of a central counterparty (CCP).

- A central counterparty (CCP) plays an important role in the clearing and settlement of transactions following the initial trade execution.
  - Clearing refers to the processes (including margining and netting) between the period from trade execution until settlement.
  - Settlement of a trade occurs when the trade is completed and all payments have been made and legal obligations satisfied.

- Key functions of a CCP related to the clearing process include: margining, novation, netting, managing the auction process, and loss mutualization.

- Loss mutualization is a form of insurance and refers to members’ contributions to a default fund to cover future losses from member defaults.

- Legal and economic terms should be standard, less complex, liquid

#### LO 47.2: Describe advantages and disadvantages of central clearing o f OTC derivatives.


#### LO 47.3: Compare margin requirements in centrally cleared and bilateral markets, and explain how margin can mitigate risk.
- CCPs set initial margin requirements based on the risk of the transactions, but not on the risk of the members.

#### LO 47.4: Compare and contrast bilateral markets to the use of novation and netting.
- The legal process of interposing the CCP between the seller and the buyer is called novation.
- When trades are novated to a CCP, these redundant trades become a single net obligation between each participant and the CCP. This process is called multilateral offsetting, or netting.

#### LO 47.5: Assess the impact o f central clearing on the broader financial markets.
- CCPs convert counterparty risk into operational and legal risk


#### LO 48.1: Identify and explain the types of risks faced by CCPs.
- The default of a clearing member and its flow through effects is the most significant risk for a CCP.
- Legal risks in the form of litigation or claims may arise due to differing laws in different jurisdictions or laws that are inconsistent with the CCPs regulations. A good example would involve the segregation and movement of margin and positions (i.e., netting) through a CCP.
#### LO 48.2: Identify and distinguish between the risks to clearing members as well as non-members.

#### LO 48.3: Identify and evaluate lessons learned from prior CCP failures.

- Operational risk must be controlled to the maximum extent possible.
- Variation margins should be recalculated often and collected quickly
- Initial margins and default funds should be sufficiently large
- CCPs must actively monitor positions, penalize overly concentrated positions, and promptly liquidate or hedge extremely large positions.
- CCPs must have one or more external sources of liquidity to avoid default due to illiquidity

#### LO 49.1: Calculate a financial institution’s overall foreign exchange exposure.
#### LO 49.2: Explain how a financial institution could alter its net position exposure to reduce foreign exchange risk.
#### LO 49.3: Calculate a financial institution’s potential dollar gain or loss exposure to a particular currency.
#### LO 49.4: Identify and describe the different types of foreign exchange trading activities.

#### LO 49.5: Identify the sources of foreign exchange trading gains and losses.
#### LO 49.6: Calculate the potential gain or loss from a foreign currency denominated investment.

#### LO 49.7: Explain balance-sheet hedging with forwards.

- On-balance-sheet hedging is achieved when a financial institution has a matched maturity and currency foreign asset-liability book.
- hedge off-balance-sheet by taking a position in the forward market. This hedge would appear as a contingent off-balance-sheet claim as an item below the net income line.

#### LO 49.8: Describe how a non-arbitrage assumption in the foreign exchange markets leads to the interest rate parity theorem, and use this theorem to calculate forward foreign exchange rates.

- interest rate parity (IRP)
- fwd = spot*e^(rDC - rFC)T
- forward = spot \[(1+rDC)/(1+rFC)]^T

#### LO 49.9: Explain why diversification in multicurrency asset-liability positions could reduce portfolio risk.
#### LO 49.10: Describe the relationship between nominal and real interest rates.

#### LO 50.1: Describe a bond indenture and explain the role of the corporate trustee in a bond indenture.
- The bond indenture is a document that sets forth the obligation of the issuer and the rights of the investors in the bonds
- One of the roles of the corporate trustee(Banks or trust companies) is to interpret this language and represent the interests of the bondholders.


- All corporate bond offerings over $5 million and sold in interstate commerce must have a corporate trustee as set forth in the Trust Indenture Act.

#### LO 50.2: Explain a bonds maturity date and how it impacts bond retirements.

- The longer the maturity of the bond, the more time a company has to retire the bond issue.

#### LO 50.3: Describe the main types of interest payment classifications.
#### LO 50.4: Describe zero-coupon bonds and explain the relationship between original-issue discount and reinvestment risk.

- The main types of bond interest payment classifications are: straight-coupon bonds, zerocoupon bonds, and floating-rate bonds.
- The interest rate on a bond is often called the coupon.

- Straight-coupon bonds, also called fixed-rate bonds, have a fixed interest rate set for the entire life of the issue. 
  - In the United States, fixed-rate bonds typically pay interest every six months.
  - Participating bonds pay at least the specified interest rate but may pay more if the company’s profits increase. 
  - Income bonds pay at most the specified interest, but they may pay less if the company’s income is not sufficient.

- Floating-rate bonds are also known as variable rate bonds. The interest paid is generally linked to some widely used reference rate such as LIBOR or the Federal Funds rate.
- Zero-coupon bonds pay the face value or principal at maturity.
  - The DIB will not pay cash interest for some number of years early in the life of the bond.
  - PIK bonds pay interest with additional bonds for the initial period, and then cash interest after that period ends.
  - Most zero-coupons issued today share a host of other features such as being convertible, callable, and putable.
    - original-issue discount (OID) = face value — offering price
  - One advantage of zero-coupon bonds is zero reinvestment risk.


#### LO 50.5: Distinguish among the following security types relevant for corporate bonds: mortgage bonds, collateral trust bonds, equipment trust certificates, subordinated and convertible debenture bonds, and guaranteed bonds.

－ Corporate bonds can have a security, such as real property, underlying the issue.
－ Mortgage bonds can be issued in a series in a blanket arrangement.
－ Collateral trust bonds are backed by stocks, notes, bonds, or other similar obligations that the company owns.

#### LO 50.6: Describe the mechanisms by which corporate bonds can be retired before maturity.

- A maintenance and replacement fund (M&R) has the same goal as a sinking fund provision, which is to maintain the credibility of the property backing the bonds.

- Tender offers are usually a means for retiring debt for most firms. The firm openly indicates an interest in buying back a certain dollar amount of bonds or, more often, all of the bonds at a set price.

#### LO 50.7: Differentiate between credit default risk and credit spread risk.

- Credit default risk is the uncertainty concerning the issuer making timely payments of interest and principal as prescribed by the bond’s indenture.

- Credit spread risk focuses on the difference between a corporate bond’s yield and the yield on a comparable-maturity benchmark Treasury security.

- A method commonly used to evaluate credit spread risk is spread duration. The duration of the spread is the approximate percentage change in a bond’s price for a 100 basis point change in the credit spread assuming that the Treasury rate is constant.

#### LO 50.8: Describe event risk and explain what may cause it in corporate bonds.
- poison put, which can require the company to repurchase the debt at or above par value in the event of a takeover not approved by the board of directors

#### LO 50.9: Define high-yield bonds, and describe types o f high-yield bond issuers and some o f the payment features unique to high yield bonds.
- High-yield bonds (a.k.a. junk bonds) are those bonds rated below investment grade by ratings agencies. This includes a broad range of ratings below the cutoff, (e.g., BB to default). Businessman’s risk refers to bonds with a rating at the bottom rung of the investment-grade category (Baa and BBB) or at the top end of the speculative-grade category (Ba and BB).

- story bonds: young and growing companies
- Fallen angels are another type of high-yield bond. events led to the ratings agencies lowering the rating

- reset bonds, deferred-coupon structures: (1) deferred-interest bonds, (2) step-up bonds, and (3) payment-in-kind bonds

#### LO 50.10: Define and differentiate between an issuer default rate and a dollar default rate.
- The issuer default rate is the number of issuers that defaulted over a year divided by the total number of issuers at the beginning of the year.
- The dollar default rate is the par value of all bonds that defaulted in a given calendar year divided by the total par value of all bonds outstanding during the year.

#### LO 50.11: Define recovery rates and describe the relationship between recovery rates and seniority.

- ETCs, or equipment trust certificates, are generally the most secure because the underlying assets are actually owned by the trustee and rented to the borrower.


#### LO 51.1: Describe the various types o f residential mortgage products.
- A mortgage is a loan that is collateralized with a specific piece of real property.

- Prime (A-grade) loans
- Subprime (B-grade) loans
- Alternative-A loans are the loans in between prime and subprime. Although they are essentially prime loans, certain characteristics of Alternative-A loans make them riskier than prime loans.

- Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) have rate changes throughout the term of the mortgage.
- The rate is usually based on a base rate (e.g., prime rate, LIBOR) plus a spread. high default risk

- Conventional loans could be securitized by either government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs): Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) or Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA).
- The GSEs have restrictions on what mortgages they can guarantee/securitize, which opened up the private label market for those participants willing to take on the risks inherent in nonconventional loans—jumbo loans (mortgage principal balance over the limit) and/or loans with high LTVs.

- With agency MBSs, the investor bears no credit risk because the GSEs have been paid a fee to guarantee the underlying mortgages.

#### LO 51.2: Calculate a fixed rate mortgage payment, and its principal and interest components.
- A conventional mortgage is the most common residential mortgage. The loan is based on the creditworthiness of the borrower and is collateralized by the residential real estate that it is used to purchase.

#### LO 51.3: Describe the mortgage prepayment option and the factors that influence prepayments.

- Seasonality. Age of mortgage pool. Personal. Housing prices. Refinancing burnout.

#### LO 51.4: Summarize the securitization process o f mortgage backed securities (M BS), particularly formation o f mortgage pools including specific pools and TBAs.
#### LO 51.5: Calculate weighted average coupon, weighted average maturity, and conditional prepayment rate (CPR) for a mortgage pool.


- pool residential mortgage loans with similar characteristics into a more diversified portfolio. They will then sell the loans to a separate entity, called a special purpose vehicle (SPY)

- A mortgage pass-through security represents a claim against a pool of mortgages. Any number of mortgages may be used to form the pool and any mortgage included in the pool is referred to as a securitized mortgage.
  - weighted average maturity (WAM)
  - weighted average coupon (WAC)
  - the time the cash flows are “passed through” to the security holders.
  - the passthroughs themselves have significant prepayment risk.

- Two industry conventions have been adopted as benchmarks for prepayment rates: the conditional prepayment rate (CPR) and the Public Securities Association (PSA) prepayment benchmark.

- The CPR is the annual rate at which a mortgage pool balance is assumed to be prepaid during the life of the pool. A mortgage pool’s CPR is a function of past prepayment rates and expected future economic conditions.

- The PSA prepayment benchmark assumes that the monthly prepayment rate for a mortgage pool increases as it ages or becomes seasoned. The PSA benchmark is expressed as a monthly series of CPRs.

- Fixed rate pass-through securities (i.e., agency mortgage pools) trade in one of the following
ways: Specified pools. To Be Announced (TBA).


#### LO 51.6: Describe a dollar roll transaction and how to value a dollar roll.
- A dollar roll transaction occurs when an MBS market maker buys positions for one settlement month and, at the same time, sells those same positions for another month.
