- Commercial banks are those that take deposits and make loans. Commercial banks include retail banks, which primarily serve individuals and small businesses, and wholesale banks, which primarily serve corporate and institutional customers.
- Investment banks are those that assist in raising capital for their customers (e.g., by managing the issuance of debt and equity securities) and advising them on corporate finance matters such as mergers and restructurings.

#### LO 31.1: Identify the major risks faced by a bank.
- The main risks faced by a bank include credit risk, market risk, and operational risk.

#### LO 31.2: Distinguish between economic capital and regulatory capital.
- To mitigate the risk of bank failures caused by losses on loans or trading assets, banks must be funded by adequate sources of capital.
- Regulatory capital refers to the amount determined by bank regulators. In terms of bank regulation, equity is referred to as “Tier 1 capital” and subordinated long-term debt is referred to as “Tier 2 capital.”
- Economic capital refers to the amount of capital that a bank believes is adequate based on its own risk models.

#### LO 31.3: Explain how deposit insurance gives rise to a moral hazard problem.
- To increase public confidence in the banking system and prevent runs on banks, most countries have established systems of deposit insurance.
- Moral hazard is the observed phenomenon that insured parties take greater risks than they would normally take if they were not insured.
- One way of mitigating moral hazard is by making insurance premiums risk-based.

#### LO 31.4: Describe investment banking financing arrangements including private placement, public offering, best efforts, firm commitment, and Dutch auction approaches.
- In a **private placement**, securities are sold directly to qualified investors with substantial wealth and investment knowledge.
  - fee income
- If the securities are sold to the investing public at large, the issuance is referred to as a **public offering**.
  - With a **firm commitment**, the investment bank agrees to purchase the entire issue at a price that is negotiated between the issuer and bank.
    - spread
  - An investment bank can also agree to distribute an issue on a **best efforts** basis rather than agreeing to purchase the whole issue.
- First-time issues of stock by firms whose shares are not currently publicly traded are called initial public offerings (IPOs).
- Dutch auction begins with a price greater than what any bidder will pay, and this price is reduced until a bidder agrees to pay it.
  - Each bidder may specify how many units they will purchase when accepting a price.
  - The price continues to be reduced until bidders have accepted all the shares. 
  - The price at which the last of the shares can be sold becomes the price paid by all successful bidders.


#### LO 31.5: Describe the potential conflicts of interest among commercial banking, securities services, and investment banking divisions o f a bank and recommend solutions to the conflict o f interest problems.
- securiteis services pressure from IB
- material nonpublic information.
- Chinese walls

#### LO 31.6: Describe the distinctions between the “banking book” and the “trading book” o f a bank.

- The banking book refers to loans made, which are the primary assets of a commercial bank.
- a nonperforming loan the value does not include accrued interest. 
  - A loan is typically classified as nonperforming if payments are more than 90 days overdue.

- The trading book refers to assets and liabilities related to a bank’s trading activities.
  - marked to market daily
  - marked to model


#### LO 31.7: Explain the originate-to-distribute model of a bank and discuss its benefits and drawbacks.
- In contrast to a bank making loans and keeping them as assets, the originate-to-distribute model involves making loans and selling them to other parties.
  - freeing up capital
  - increase liquidity in sectors of the loan market
  - led banks to loosen lending standards


#### LO 32.1: Describe the key features o f the various categories o f insurance companies and identify the risks facing insurance companies.

- Three categories of insurance companies include life insurance, property and casualty (nonlife) insurance, and health insurance.
- term and whole life insurance
- Property insurance covers property losses such as fire and theft.

- Casualty (liability) insurance covers third-party liability for injuries sustained while on a policyholder’s premises or caused by the policyholder’s use of a vehicle
  - Liability insurance is subject to long-tail risk

- Major risks facing insurance companies
  - Insufficient funds to satisfy policyholders’ claims
  - Poor return on investments
  - Liquidity risk o f investments
  - Credit risk
  - Operational risk


#### LO 32.2: Describe the use o f mortality tables and calculate the premium payment for a policy holder.

- When examining the full table, the probability of death during the following year is a decreasing function of age until age 10 and then it increases.

- With the information in the mortality tables, we can calculate the breakeven premium payment by equating the present value of the expected payout to the present value of the expected premium payments


#### LO 32.3: Calculate and interpret loss ratio, expense ratio, combined ratio, and operating ratio for a property-casualty insurance company.

- The loss ratio for a given year is the percentage of payouts versus premiums generated, usually between 60—80% and increasing over time.
- The expense ratio for a given year is the percentage of expenses versus premiums generated, usually between 23—30% and decreasing over time. The largest expenses are usually loss adjustments (e.g., claims investigation and assessing payout amounts) and selling (e.g., broker commissions).
- The combined ratio for a given year is equal to the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio.
- The combined ratio after dividends for a given year is equal to the combined ratio plus the payment of dividends to policyholders (if applicable).
- The operating ratio for a given year is the combined ratio (after dividends) less
investment income.


#### LO 32.4: Describe moral hazard and adverse selection risks facing insurance companies, provide examples o f each, and describe how to overcome the problems.

- Moral hazard describes the risk to the insurance company that having insurance will lead the policyholder to act more recklessly than if the policyholder did not have insurance.
- Methods to mitigate against moral hazard include: deductibles (e.g., policyholder is responsible for a fixed amount of the loss), coinsurance provisions (e.g., insurance company will pay a fixed percentage of losses, less than 100%, over the deductible amount), and policy limits (e.g., fixed maximum payout).

- Adverse selection describes the situation where an insurer is unable to differentiate between a good risk and a bad risk.
- Methods to mitigate against adverse selection include: (1) greater initial due diligence (e.g., mandatory physical examinations for life insurance, researching driving records for automobile insurance) and (2) ongoing due diligence (e.g., updating driving records and adjusting premiums to reflect changing risk).

## LO 32.5: Distinguish between mortality risk and longevity risk and describe how to hedge these risks.

- Mortality risk refers to the risk of policyholders dying earlier than expected due to illness or disease, for example.
- Longevity risk refers to the risk of policyholders living longer than expected due to better healthcare and healthier lifestyle choices, for example
- There is a natural hedge (or offset) for insurance companies that deal with both life insurance products and annuity products.
  - longevity risk good for the life insurance
  - Mortality risk is good for the annuity business

- To the extent that there is excessive net exposure to mortality risk, longevity risk, or both, an insurance company may consider reinsurance contracts.

## LO 32.6: Evaluate the capital requirements for life insurance and property-casualty insurance companies. 
- life insurance
  - Assets: investments (80%), other assets (20%)
  - Liabilities and Equity: policy reserves (85%), subordinated long-term debt (5%), equity capital (10%)
- A P&C insurance company
  - Assets: investments (80%), other assets (20%)
  - Liabilities and Equity: policy reserves (50%), unearned premiums (10%), subordinated long-term debt (5%), equity capital (35%)
- Under an asset-liability management approach, the life insurance company attempts to equate asset duration with liability duration.
- For P&C insurance companies, assets typically comprise of highly liquid bonds with shorter maturities than those used by life insurance companies.
#### LO 32.7: Compare the guaranty system and the regulatory requirements for insurance companies with those for banks.
- In the United States, a guaranty system exists for both insurance companies and banks. Insurance companies are regulated at the state level while banks are regulated at the federal level.
- insurance companies must make contributions whenever a default occurs.
- the guaranty system for banks is a permanent fund to protect depositors and consists of amounts remitted by banks to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

#### LO 32.8: Describe a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan for a pension fund and explain the differences between them.
- Defined benefit plans (i.e., employee benefit known, employer contribution unknown) explicitly state the amount of the pension that the employee will receive upon retirement.

- Defined contribution plans (i.e., employer contribution known, employee benefit unknown) involve both employer and employee contributions being invested in one or more investment options selected by the employee.


- Liability insurance is subject to long-tail risk, which is the risk of legitimate claims being submitted years after the insurance coverage has ended.


#### LO 33.1: Differentiate among open-end mutual funds, closed-end mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
- Mutual funds are pooled investment vehicles that offer instant diversification for their investors.
- Open-end mutual funds, which are often simply called mutual funds, are the most common pooled investment vehicle
  - broken down into four main categories: money market funds, equity funds, bond funds, and hybrid funds
  - Open-end funds trade at the fund’s net asset value (NAV), which is essentially the sum of all assets owned minus any liabilities of the fund then divided by the shares outstanding.
  - poor price visibility
- Sales charges are commonly called loads. A front-end load is a set percentage that is charged to the investor when the asset is originally sold. Alternatively, some funds choose to charge a sales charge if an investor leaves a fund within a certain window of time. This is called a back-end load.


- The first difference is that closed-end funds tend to invest in niche areas like specific emerging markets, while open-end mutual funds tend to invest in broader areas like a diversified emerging markets fund.
- The second difference is that a purchase of shares in an open-end mutual fund will increase the number of shares outstanding because new shares are created, but a closed-end fund’s number of shares remains static.
  - Investors who desire to purchase shares of a closed-end fund do not transact direcdy with the fund company but rather with other investors.
- It is very common for a closed-end fund to trade at either a discount or a premium to its actual NAV.
- Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent an innovative twist on the open-end mutual fund.
  - exchange-traded
  - vast majority of ETFs are passively managed index funds

- They are all regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and must register with the SEC and provide a very detailed disclosure document, called a prospectus, to all investors prior to investing.

#### LO 33.2: Calculate the net asset value (NAY) of an open-end mutual fund.
- NAV = (fund assets — fund liabilities) / total shares outstanding

#### LO 33.3: Explain the key differences between hedge funds and mutual funds.

- Hedge funds are also permitted to use leverage while mutual funds are not.
  - advance notification. 90d
  - lock-up period
  - illiquid

#### LO 33.4: Calculate the return on a hedge fund investment and explain the incentive fee structure of a hedge fund including the terms hurdle rate, high-water mark, and clawback.
- These incentive fees are engineered to give hedge fund managers significant payouts based on their performance. The typical hedge fund fee structure is known as “2 plus 20%,”
  - The first safeguard is the hurdle rate, which is the benchmark that must be beaten before incentive fees can be charged\
  - The second safeguard is a high-water mark clause, which essentially states that previous losses must first be recouped and hurdle rates surpassed before incentive fees once again apply.

  - The third safeguard for investors is a clawback clause, which enables investors to retain a portion of previously paid incentive fees in an escrow account that is used to offset investment losses should they occur.
  - encouraging fund managers to take risks

- LO 33.5: Describe various hedge fund strategies, including long/short equity, dedicated short, distressed securities, merger arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, fixed income arbitrage, emerging markets, global macro, and managed fixtures, and identify the risks faced by hedge funds.

- Long/short equity hedge funds endeavor to find mispriced securities.
  - fundamental analysis
  - sector neutral, Market neutralfunds, factor neutral funds
- Dedicated short hedge funds are focused exclusively on finding a company that they think is overvalued and then short selling the stock.

- Bonds with a credit rating of BB or less are considered to be “junk” bonds, while those with a CCC rating are considered to be “distressed.”
  - passively wait, active approach to influencing
- Merger arbitrage hedge funds try to find arbitrage opportunities after mergers are announced.
  - cash deals and stock deals.
  - great potential for insider trading issues.
- Fixed income arbitrage hedge funds attempt to exploit perceived mispricings in the realm of fixed-income securities.
  - picking up nickels in front of a steamroller.

- Emerging market hedge funds focus on investments in developing countries.
  - American depository receipts (ADRs)
- hedge fund managers attempt to profit from a global macroeconomic trend that they feel is not in equilibrium (priced correctly and rationally).

- Managed futures hedge funds attempt to predict future movements in commodity prices based on either technical analysis or fundamental analysis.

#### LO 33.6: Describe hedge fund performance and explain the effect o f measurement biases on performance measurement.

- measurement bias of hedge fund index reporting
- When returns are reported by a hedge fund, the database is then backfilled with the fund’s previous returns.
- Protection during periods of stock market volatility is one hallmark of hedge funds as they actively pursue short selling when traditional mutual funds are not allowed to do so.


- Open-end mutual funds can only be bought or sold using a market order. Closed-end funds can be bought or sold using stop orders and limit orders. In some cases, ETFs can be sold short.

- An open outcry system and electronic trading system are different forms of trading securities (matching buyers with sellers). The open outcry system (e.g., CBOT) is the more traditional system, which involves traders actually indicating their trades through hand signals and shouting.

#### LO 34.1: Describe the over-the-counter market, distinguish it from trading on an exchange, and evaluate its advantages and disadvantages.
- Terms are not set by any exchange.
- negotiate
- calls are recorded
- more credit risk
#### LO 34.2: Differentiate between options, forwards, and futures contracts.

- A forward contract is a contract that specifies the price and quantity of an asset to be delivered sometime in the future.
- A futures contract is a more formalized, legally binding agreement to buy/sell a commodity/ financial instrument in a pre-designated month in the future, at a price agreed upon today by the buyer/seller.

#### LO 34.3: Identify and calculate option and forward contract payoffs.

- The price paid for the call option, CQ, is referred to as the call premium.

#### LO 34.4: Calculate and compare the payoffs from hedging strategies involving forward contracts and options.

- Hedgers use forward contracts and options to reduce or eliminate financial exposure.


#### LO 34.5: Calculate and compare the payoffs from speculative strategies involving futures and options.
- Speculators use derivatives to make bets on the market, while hedgers try to eliminate exposures.


#### LO 34.6: Calculate an arbitrage payoff and describe how arbitrage opportunities are temporary.
- Arbitrageurs are also frequent users of derivatives.

#### LO 34.7: Describe some of the risks that can arise from the use o f derivatives.



#### LO 35.1: Define and describe the key features of a futures contract, including the asset, the contract price and size, delivery, and limits.
#### LO 35.9: Compare and contrast forward and futures contracts.
- Most futures positions are not held to take delivery of the underlying good. Instead, they are closed out or reversed prior to the settlement date.
- Open interest is the total number of long positions in a given futures contract.

- Futures contract characteristics
  - Quality o f the underlying asset. Contract size.
  - Delivery location. Delivery time.
  - Price quotations and tick size. Daily price limits(limit down/up). Position limits.


#### LO 35.2: Explain the convergence of futures and spot prices.

- The basis is the difference between the spot price and the futures price.

#### LO 35.3: Describe the rationale for margin requirements and explain how they work.
- Margin is cash or highly liquid collateral placed in an account to ensure that any trading losses will be met.
- The amount required to open a futures position is called the initial margin. The maintenance margin is the minimum margin account balance required to retain the futures position.
- gets a margin call, and he must bring the margin account back to the initial margin amount. The amount necessary to do this is called the variation margin.


#### LO 35.4: Describe the role of a clearinghouse in futures and over-the-counter market transactions.


#### LO 35-5: Describe the role of collateralization in the over-the-counter market and compare it to the margining system.

#### LO 35.6: Identify the differences between a normal and inverted futures market.
- The settlement price is analogous to the closing price for a stock but is not simply the price of the last trade. It is an average of the prices of the trades during the last period of trading, called the closing period, which is set by the exchange.
- Increasing settlement prices over time indicates a normal market. Conversely, decreasing settlement prices over time indicates an inverted market

#### LO 35.7: Describe the mechanics o f the delivery process and contrast it with cash settlement.

#### LO 35.8: Evaluate the impact of different trading order types.

- A limit buy order is placed below the current price. A limit sell order is placed above the current price.

- Stop-limit orders: once the stop level is reached, or bettered, the order would turn into a limit order and hopefully transact at the limit price. 
- Market-if-touched orders, or MIT orders, are orders that would become market orders once a specified price is reached in the marketplace.

- Another difference is that capital losses are deductible for non-corporate taxpayers.
- Gains/losses on hedging transactions are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income.
