### the time value of money
- time value of money(TVM)
- at the end of the investment horizon (FV - compounding.) or at the beginning of the investment horizon (PV - discounting).
- think of I/Y as the interest rate per compounding period and N as the number of compounding periods under analysis
- keys
  - N = Number of compounding periods.
  - I/Y = Interest rate per compounding period.
  - PV = Present value.
  - FV = Future value.
  - PMT = Annuity payments, or constant periodic cash flow.
  - CPT = Compute.

- Equilibrium interest rates are the required rate of return for a particular investment
  - interest rates = discount rates, opportunity cost of current consumption, required rate of return, and the cost of capital
- The real risk-free rate of interest is a theoretical rate on a single period loan that has no expectation of inflation in it.
  - T-bill(U.S. Treasury bills) rates are nominal risk-free rates because they contain an inflation premium.
- Default risk: The risk that a borrower will not make the promised payments in a timely manner.
- Liquidity risk: The risk of receiving less than fair value for an investment if it must be sold for cash quickly.
- Maturity risk: the prices of longer-term bonds are more volatile than those of shorter-term bonds
- An annuity is a stream of **equal** cash flows that occurs at equal intervals over a given period.
  - The ordinary annuity is the most common type of annuity. It is characterized by cash flows that occur at the end of each compounding period.
  - the PMT variable is a single periodic payment
- A perpetuity is a financial instrument that pays a fixed amount of money at set intervals over an **infinite** period of time.
  - British consul bonds and most preferred stocks are examples of perpetuities since they promise fixed interest or dividend payments forever.
  - PVperp = PMT/(I/Y)
- to find the PV or FV of this cash flow stream, all we need to do is sum the PVs or FVs of the individual cash flows
- since an increase in the frequency of compounding increases the effective rate of interest, it also increases the FV of a given cash flow and decreases the PV of a given cash flow.
  - m equal the number of compounding periods per year,
  - I/Y = the annual interest rate / m
  - N = the number of years x m
- PV and FV must in diff sign

### random variables
#### LO 15.1: Describe and distinguish between continuous and discrete random variables.
- A random variable is an uncertain quantity/number.
- An outcome is an observed value of a random variable.
- An event is a single outcome or a set of outcomes.
- Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot happen at the same time.
- Exhaustive events are those that include all possible outcomes.
- A probability distribution describes the probabilities of all the possible outcomes for a random variable.
- A discrete random variable is one for which the number of possible outcomes can be counted, and for each possible outcome, there is a measurable and positive probability.
- A probability function, denoted p(x), specifies the probability that a random variable is equal to a specific value.
- A continuous random variable is one for which the number of possible outcomes is infinite, even if lower and upper bounds exist.

- It is customary to speak in terms of the probability of a range of possible price change


### distribution function
#### LO 13.2: Define and distinguish between the probability density function, the
cumulative distribution function, and the inverse cumulative distribution function.

- A probability density function (pdf) is a function, denoted f(x), that can be used to generate the probability that outcomes of a continuous distribution lie within a particular range of outcomes.
  - For a discrete distribution, it is the equivalent of a probability function for a discrete distribution.
  - for a continuous distribution, the probability
of any one particular outcome (of the infinite possible outcomes) is zero. A pdf is used to calculate the probability of an outcome between two values
- A cumulative distribution function (cdf), or simply distribution function, defines the probability that a random variable, X, takes on a value equal to or less than a specific value, x.
- inverse cumulative distribution function can be used to find the value that corresponds to a specific probability.


### discrete probability function
#### LO 15.3: Calculate the probability of an event given a discrete probability function.
- A discrete uniform random variable is one for which the probabilities for all possible outcomes for a discrete random variable are equal.

### conditional probability
#### LO 15.6: Define and calculate a conditional probability, and distinguish between conditional and unconditional probabilities.
- Unconditional probability (i.e., marginal probability) refers to the probability of an event regardless of the past or future occurrence of other events.
- A conditional probability is one where the occurrence of one event affects the probability of the occurrence of another event.
  - P(A | B), where the vertical bar (|) indicates “given,” or “conditional upon.”
  - A conditional probability of an occurrence is also called its likelihood.
- The joint probability of two events is the probability that they will both occur.
  - multiplication rule o f probability.
  - P(AB) = P(A | B) x P(B)

### independent and mutually exclusive events
#### LO 15.4: Distinguish between independent and mutually exclusive events.
- Independent events refer to events for which the occurrence of one has no influence on the occurrence of the others.
- The addition rule fo r probabilities is used to determine the probability that at least one of two events will occur.
