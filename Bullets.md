## LO 1.1
- Risk arises from the uncertainty regarding an entity’s future losses as well as future gains.
- Risk management includes the sequence of activities aimed to reduce or eliminate an entity’s
potential to incur expected losses. 
- Risk taking refers specifically to the active assumption of
incremental risk in order to generate incremental gains.
### LO 1.2
In its basic format, the risk management process is as follows:
- Step 1: Identify the risks.
- Step 2 : Quantify and estimate the risk exposures or determine appropriate methods to
transfer the risks.
- Step 3 : Determine the collective effects of the risk exposures or perform a cost-benefit
analysis on risk transfer methods.
- Step 4: Develop a risk mitigation strategy (i.e., avoid, transfer, mitigate, or assume risk).
- Step 5: Assess performance and amend risk mitigation strategy as needed.
### LO 1.3
- Value at risk (VaR) states a certain loss amount and its probability of occurring.
- Economic capital refers to holding sufficient liquid reserves to cover a potential loss.
- Scenario analysis takes into account potential risk factors with uncertainties that are often
non-quantifiable.
- Stress testing is a form of scenario analysis that examines a financial outcome based on a
given “stress” on the entity.
- Enterprise risk management takes an integrative approach to risk management within an
entire entity, dispensing of the traditional approach of independently managing risk within
each department or division of an entity.
### LO 1.4
- Expected loss considers how much an entity expects to lose in the normal course of
business. It can often be computed in advance (and provided for) with relative ease because
of the certainty involved.
- Unexpected loss considers how much an entity could lose usually outside of the normal
course of business. Compared to expected loss, it is generally more difficult to predict,
compute, and provide for in advance because of the uncertainty involved.
### LO 1.5
- There is a trade-off between risk and reward. In very general and simplified terms, the
greater the risk taken, the greater the potential reward. However, one must consider the
variability of the potential reward. The portion of the variability that is measurable as a
probability function could be thought of as risk whereas the portion that is not measurable
could be thought of as uncertainty.
### LO 1.6
- There are eight key classes of risk: (1) market risk, (2) credit risk, (3) liquidity risk,
(4) operational risk, (5) legal and regulatory risk, (6) business risk, (7) strategic risk, and
(8) reputation risk.
- Market risk considers how changes in market prices and rates will result in investment
losses. There are four subtypes of market risk: (1) interest rate risk, (2) equity price risk,
(3) foreign exchange risk, and (4) commodity price risk.
- Credit risk refers to a loss suffered by a party whereby the counterparty fails to meet its
financial obligations to the party under the contract. Credit risk may also arise if there is
an increasing risk of default by the counterparty throughout the duration of the contract.
There are four subtypes of credit risk: (1) default risk, (2) bankruptcy risk, (3) downgrade
risk, and (4) settlement risk.
- Liquidity risk is subdivided into two parts: (1) funding liquidity risk and (2) trading
liquidity risk. Funding liquidity risk occurs when an entity is unable to pay down or
refinance its debt, satisfy any cash obligations to counterparties, or fund any capital
withdrawals. Trading liquidity risk occurs when an entity is unable to buy or sell a security
at the market price due to a temporary inability to find a counterparty to transact on the
other side of the trade.
- Operational risk considers a wide range of non-financial problems such as inadequate
computer systems, insufficient internal controls, incompetent management, fraud, human
error, and natural disasters.
- Legal risk could arise when one party sues the other party in an attempt to nullify or
terminate the transaction. Regulatory risk could arise from changes in laws and regulations
that are unfavorable to the entity (e.g., higher tax rates, higher compliance costs).
- Business risk revolves around uncertainty regarding the entity’s income statement. Revenues
may be uncertain because of the uncertainty surrounding the demand for the products and/
or the price that should be set. Production and administration costs may also be uncertain.
- Strategic risk can be thought of in the context of large new business investments, which
carry a high degree of uncertainty as to ultimate success and profitability. Alternatively,
it could be thought of from the perspective of an entity changing its business strategy
compared to its competitors.
- Reputation risk consists of two parts: (1) the general perceived trustworthiness of an
entity (i.e., that the entity is able and willing to meet its obligations to its creditors and
counterparties) and (2) the general perception that the entity engages in fair dealing and
conducts business in an ethical manner.

### LO 2.1
- There are some theoretical reasons for a firm not to hedge risk exposures but most of those
reasons make the unrealistic assumption of perfect capital markets, which is not realistic.
Also, they ignore the existence of the significant costs of financial distress and bankruptcy.
- However, in practice, there are some valid reasons not to hedge, including the distraction
from focusing on the core business, lack of skills and knowledge, and transaction and
compliance costs.
- Many reasons exist for a firm to hedge its risk exposures. Key reasons include lowering the
cost of capital, reducing volatility of reported earnings, operational improvements, and
potential cost savings over traditional insurance products.
### LO 2.2
- The board, together with management, should set the firms risk appetite using one or
more of the following tools: qualitative statements of risk tolerance, value at risk, and stress
testing. A firm must know its risk and return goals before embarking on a risk management
plan. These goals must be clear and actionable.
### LO 2.3
- In hedging specific risk factors, it is necessary to consider the role of the board of directors
as well as the process of mapping. There should be clarification whether accounting or
economic profits are to be hedged. Likewise, there should be clarification whether short-term
or long-term accounting profits are to be hedged. Other points the board should
consider include the time horizon and the possibility of implementing definitive and
quantitative risk limits.
- Mapping risks requires clarification as to which risks are insurable, hedgeable, noninsurable,
or nonhedgeable. Mapping risks could be performed for various risks such as market, credit,
business, and operational. Essentially it involves a detailed analysis of the impacts of such
risks on the firm’s financial position (balance sheet) and financial performance (income
statement).
### LO 2.4
- Hedging operational risks tend to cover a firm’s income statement activities while hedging
financial risks tend to cover the balance sheet. 
- Pricing risk could be thought of as a type of
operational risk, requiring the hedging of revenues and costs. 
- Foreign currency risk refers
to the risk of economic loss due to unfavorable changes in the foreign currency exchange
rate; to the extent that there is production and sales activity in the foreign currency pricing
risk would exist simultaneously
- Interest rate risk refers to the risk inherent in a firm’s net
exposure to unfavorable interest rate fluctuations.
