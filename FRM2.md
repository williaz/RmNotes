R = lnP1 - lnP0


VaR
loss day
loss value
loss possibility

u +/- 1.65o

- Profit/Loss
  - P/L: substraction
  - Arithmetic Return: r: ratio
  - Geometric Return: Rt: log ratio, = ln(1 + r)
    - diff is negligible in short term, may substantial long term
- VaR
  - normal VaR
    - arithmetic return is normal
    - geometric return is normal: 1- e^avar
  - Cohension risk measure
    - weighed VaR
    - eventually converge as num of slice larger
  - Conditional VaR: expected shortfall, E on value left of VaR
- Quantile-Quantile Plots
  - test if data fit a distribution -> linear

## Risk Management and Portfolio management
### Factor Theory
- risk factor
  - diff under diff circumstance
  - not asset
  - will be compensated by risk premiums
  - CAPM: beta
  - SDF: stochastic discount factors
  - Multifactor model: like APT(arbitrage pricing theory)
- Gold: assets paying off in bad times have **low** risk premiums(>0), in some circumtance, they are also defined as valuable assets 
- Efficient Market Theory: weak, semi-strong, and strong efficiency; nearly efficiency
- There are seven major shortcomings of CAPM
  - Investors only have financial wealth.(human wealth)
  - Investors have mean-variance utility.
  - Investors have single period investment horizon. 
  - Investors have homogeneous (identical) expectations.
  - Market are frictionless. 
  - All investors are price takers. (can't affect market)
  - Information is free and available to everyone.
