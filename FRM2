- Profit/Loss
  - P/L: substraction
  - Arithmetic Return: r: ratio
  - Geometric Return: Rt: log ratio, = ln(1 + r)
    - diff is negligible in short term, may substantial long term
- VaR
  - normal VaR
    - arithmetic return is normal
    - geometric return is normal: 1- e^avar
  - Cohension risk measure
    - weighed VaR
    - eventually converge as num of slice larger
  - Conditional VaR: expected shortfall, E on value left of VaR
- Quantile-Quantile Plots
  - test if data fit a distribution -> linear
