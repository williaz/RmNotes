### the concept of risk
#### LO 1.1: Explain the concept of risk and compare risk management with risk taking.
- there is a natural trade-off between risk and return
- The more important concern is the variability of the loss, especially a loss that could rise to unexpectedly high levels or a loss that suddenly occurs that was not anticipated.
- risk management includes the sequence of activities aimed to reduce or eliminate an entity’s potential to incur expected losses.
- Risk taking refers specifically to the active assumption of incremental risk in order to generate incremental gains.

### the risk management process
#### LO 1.2: Describe the risk management process and identify problems and challenges that can arise in the risk management process.
- Five steps: 
  - Step 1: Identify the risks.
  - Step 2: Quantify and estimate the risk exposures or determine appropriate methods to transfer the risks.
  - Step 3: Determine the collective effects of the risk exposures or perform a cost-benefit analysis on risk transfer methods.
  - Step 4: Develop a risk mitigation strategy (i.e., avoid, transfer, mitigate, or assume risk).
  - Step 5: Assess performance and amend risk mitigation strategy as needed.
- Two key problems
  - identifying the correct risk(s)
  - finding an efficient method of transferring the risk
- Chllenges:
  - risk must be sufficiently dispersed among willing and able participants in the economy
  - consistently assist in preventing market disruptions or preventing financial accounting fraud (due to corporate governance failures).
  - risk management may not be effective on an overall economic basis, a zero-sum game

### measure and manage risk
#### LO 1.3: Evaluate and apply tools and procedures used to measure and manage risk, including quantitative measures, qualitative assessment, and enterprise risk management.
- Quantitative Measures
  - Value at risk (VaR) states a certain loss amount and its probability of occurring. VaR is a useful measure for liquid positions operating under normal market circumstances over a short period of time.
  - Economic capital refers to holding sufficient liquid reserves to cover a potential loss.
- Qualitative Assessment
  - Scenario analysis takes into account potential risk factors with uncertainties that are often non-quantifiable.
    - an adverse scenario or worst-case scenario analysis
  - Stress testing is a form of scenario analysis that examines a financial outcome based on a given “stress” on the entity.
- Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
  - ERM considers entity-wide risks and tries to integrate risk considerations into key business decisions.

### expected loss and unexpected loss
#### LO 1.4: Distinguish between expected loss and unexpected loss, and provide examples o f each.
in advance, with ease, certainty
- Expected loss considers how much an entity expects to lose in the normal course of business.
- Unexpected loss considers how much an entity could lose outside of the normal course of business.
  - **correlation risk drives up the potential losses to unexpected levels** <- historical analysis

### risk and reward
#### LO 1.5: Interpret the relationship between risk and reward and explain how conflicts o f interest can impact risk management.
- variability of the potential reward. 
  - The portion of the variability that is measurable as a probability function could be thought of as risk whereas the portion that is not measurable could be thought of as uncertainty.

### classes of risks
#### LO 1.6: Describe and differentiate between the key classes of risks, explain how each type o f risk can arise, and assess the potential impact o f each type o f risk on an organization.
- Market risk: how changes in market prices and rates will result in investment losses.
  - (1) interest rate risk
  - (2) equity price risk: volatility of stock prices, general market risk & specific risk
  - (3) foreign exchange risk: unhedged or not fully hedged foreign currency positions.
  - (4) commodity price risk
- Credit risk: a loss suffered by a party whereby the counterparty fails to meet its financial obligations to the party under the contract.
  - (1) default risk
  - (2) bankruptcy risk
  - (3) downgrade risk: publicly traded
  - (4) settlement risk
- Liquidity Risk
  - (1) funding liquidity risk
  - (2) trading liquidity risk
- Operational Risk: non-financial risk
- Legal and Regulatory Risk
- Business Risk: income nstatement
- Strategic risk
- Reputation Risk
  - (1) the general perceived trustworthiness of an entity
  - (2) the general perception that the entity engages in fair dealing and conducts business in an ethical manner.

### hedging risk exposures
#### LO 2.1: Evaluate some advantages and disadvantages of hedging risk exposures.
- perfect capital markets
- hedging involves the use of financial derivatives VS insuring involves the use of insurance policies;
- in practice, hedging with derivatives may not be a zero-sum game of transferring risk between periods or between participants.

### hedging decisions
#### LO 2.2: Explain considerations and procedures in determining a firm’s risk appetite and its business objectives.
#### LO 2.3: Explain how a company can determine whether to hedge specific risk factors, including the role of the board of directors and the process of mapping risks.
- A major conclusion to consider with the risk/return trade-off is that firms should accept all projects with a positive net present value (NPV), taking into account risk, because it will maximize value for the firm’s stakeholders.
- a firm must know its risk and return goals before embarking on a risk management plan.
- firm’s risk appetite, approved by the board of directors
- conflict between the two major stakeholders—debtholders and shareholders.
- The bottom line is that it is not possible to hedge both accounting and economic risk at the same time, so a choice between the two must be made.
- the issue of hedging short-term versus long-term accounting profits
- time horizon
- Liquidity, accounting, and tax effects need to be considered.
- implement definitive and quantitative risk limits
- the firm should also research and identify the top 10 risk exposures it faces.

### hedge operational and financial risks
#### LO 2.4: Apply appropriate methods to hedge operational and financial risks, including pricing, foreign currency, and interest rate risk.
- Pricing Risk: the cost of inputs <- 
- The goal of hedging foreign currency risk is to control exposure to exchange rate fluctuations that impact future cash flows and the fair value of assets and liabilities.
- foreign exchange rate fluctuations <- forward or futures contract locking cost
  - currency put options (to ensure a known absolute minimum return should the exchange rate fall beyond the strike rate) 
  - forward contracts (to ensure a known return based on n exchange rate determined in advance and acceptable by the firm)
- The goal of hedging interest rate risk is to control the firm’s net exposure (asset or liability) to unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. <- interest rate swaps
- Static vs. Dynamic Hedging Strategies
- hedging considerations:
  - relevant time horizons for hedging -> performance evaluations
  - complex financial accounting
  - tax, law

### risk management instruments
#### LO 2.5: Assess the impact of risk management instruments.
- time horizon
- fully insure, partially insure, or not to insure (i.e., self-insure)
- exchange traded or over the counter (OTC)

### best practices
#### LO 3.1: Compare and contrast best practices in corporate governance with those of risk management.
- Corporate Governance
  - The board of directors should be comprised of a majority of independent members
  - The board should be watching out for the interests of the shareholders and other stakeholders(debtholders)
  - The board should be aware of any agency risks(personal remuneration)
  - The board should maintain its independence from management.
  - The board should consider the introduction of a chief risk officer (CRO).
    - CRO should not be a member of the board
- Risk Management
  - The board of directors should demand substance over form.
  - The board should set up an ethics committee
  - the board should ensure that performance measurement and compensation for all staff is consistent with the firm’s goals and the shareholders’ interests.
  - ensuring the transactions are within the established risk appetite and consistent with the firm’s overall business strategy.
  - The board should have a risk committee in place, which is separate from the audit committee
  - 

### risk governance
#### LO 3.2: Assess the role and responsibilities of the board of directors in risk governance.
#### LO 3.4: Distinguish the different mechanisms for transmitting risk governance throughout an organization.
- Risk Advisory Director: A risk advisory director would be a board member who is a risk specialist who attends risk committee and audit committee meetings and provides advice to increase effectiveness.
- Risk Management Committee: identifying, measuring, and monitoring financial risks; approving credit facilities that are above certain limits or a specific threshold
- Compensation Committee: to discuss and approve the remuneration of key management personnel.
- Audit Committee

### audit committee
#### LO 3.6: Assess the role and responsibilities of a firms audit committee.
- for the reasonable accuracy of the firm’s financial statements and its regulatory reporting requirements.

### risk appetite and business strategy
#### LO 3.3: Evaluate the relationship between a firm’s risk appetite and its business strategy, including the role of incentives.
- A firm’s risk appetite reflects its tolerance (especially willingness) to accept risk.
- defining the firm’s risk limits sets some bounds to its business strategy and to its ability to exploit business opportunities.

### interdependence of functional units
#### LO 3.5: Illustrate the interdependence of functional units within a firm as it relates to risk management.
- (1) senior management
- (2) risk management

### enterprise risk management
#### LO 4.1: Describe enterprise risk management (ERM) and compare and contrast differing definitions o f ERM.
- ERM is a comprehensive and integrated framework for managing key risks in order to achieve business objectives, minimize unexpected earnings volatility, and maximize firm value. -> independence, fragmented information

### ERM benefits and costs
#### LO 4.2: Compare the benefits and costs of ERM and describe the motivations for a firm to adopt an ERM initiative.
- (1) integration of risk organization
- (2) integration of risk transfer
- (3) integration of business processes.

### chief risk officer
#### LO 4.3: Describe the role and responsibilities of a chief risk officer (CRO) and assess how the CRO should interact with other senior management.
- for all risks facing a company, including market, credit, operational, and liquidity risks, and specifically responsible for developing and implementing an ERM strategy.
- dual reporting to both the CEO/CFO and to the board.

### ERM framework components
#### LO 4.4: Distinguish between components of an ERM program.
- (1) corporate governance
- (2) line management: the management of activities that relate directly to producing a firm’s products and services.
- (3) portfolio management
- (4) risk transfer
- (5) risk analytics
- (6) data and technology resources
- (7) stakeholder management.


### optimal level of risk
#### LO 5.1: Assess methods that banks can use to determine their optimal level of risk exposure, and explain how the optimal level of risk can differ across banks.
- Targeting a certain default probability or targeting a specific credit rating.
- Sensitivity analysis or scenario analysis.
- The optimal level of risk depends on the specific focus of the bank’s activities

### risk-taking implications
#### LO 5.2: Describe implications for a bank if it takes too little or too much risk compared to its optimal level.
- return, value
#### LO 5.3: Explain ways in which risk management can add or destroy value for a bank.
- if there is a very high cost of having incremental risk above the optimal level, then there is value in having a risk management department to ensure compliance with specific risk limits.
- a more flexible and properly functioning risk management process would allow a bank to take on profitable risks and take advantage of investment opportunities that could increase its value.
- add value by requiring all business units to take the perspective of the entire bank when making decisions regarding risks.
- The total amount of risk that the bank is able to take is dependent on all of the risks taken by the various business units. As a result, the risk management function can add value by requiring the business units to take the perspective of the entire bank when making decisions regarding risks.
- If there is a very high cost of having incremental risk above the optimal level, then there is value in having a risk management department to ensure compliance with specific risk limits.
- If there is a very low cost of having incremental risk above the optimal level, then the fixed costs of having a risk management department may outweigh the benefits, thereby destroying value for the bank.
- If a bank has a risk management process that is very inflexible in order to manage the bank’s risk below a set acceptable threshold level, it may end up controlling risk but not allowing for any value creation.

### risk management challenges and limitations
#### LO 5.4: Describe structural challenges and limitations to effective risk management, including the use of VaR in setting limits.
- Real-time risk measures do not exist for entire banks
- inaccurate risk measures
- VaR
  - not having enough history data
  - unknown risks
  - credit and operational risks have distributions that are both fat-tailed and very skewed.

### bank risk profile and performance
#### LO 5.5: Assess the potential impact of a banks governance, incentive structure, and risk culture on its risk profile and its performance.
- One study on the link between culture and risk outcomes demonstrates that there is a strong negative relation between unexpected performance and the strength of corporate culture.


#### LO 6.1: Analyze the key factors that led to and derive the lessons learned from the following risk management case studies:
- Chase Manhattan and their involvement with Drysdale Securities
  - unsecured borrowing
  - misrepresentation in obtaining loans
- Kidder Peabody: 
  - artificially profit
  - report false profits -> investigating large profits from unknown trading strategies.<- accounting error in computer system
- Barings: 
  - two role -> independent trading back office
  - little management oversight of the settlement process
- Allied Irish Bank
  - imaginary trades offset real one
- Union Bank o f Switzerland (UBS): 
  - failed to properly analyze and stress test its positions.
  - independent risk oversight
- Societe Generate
large unexpected market movements:
- Long Term Capital Management (LTCM)
- Metallgesellschaft
  - The fundamental problem at Metallgesellschaft was that the timing of the marked to market losses and margin calls on its futures contracts were mismatched with the cash flows on the forward contracts it was trying to hedge. 
  - The problem was compounded by the enormous size of the positions, which made liquidation costly, and by conservative financial reporting requirements that did not recognize the gains on the forward contracts.
- Bankers Trust
- JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Enron
- 

### key factors to the housing bubble
#### LO 7.1: Describe the key factors the led to the housing bubble.
- Cheap credit
- Decline in lending standards

### banking industry trends & the liquidity crisis
#### LO 7.2: Explain the banking industry trends leading up to the liquidity squeeze and assess the triggers for the liquidity crisis.
- liquidity squeeze
  - Risk transference through asset securitization
  - Asset-liability maturity mismatch

### collateralized debt obligations(CDO)
#### LO 7.3: Explain how banks created collateralized debt obligations.
- 1. Form a diversified portfolio
- 2. Slice the portfolio into tranches.
- 3. Sell tranches to investors


### credit default swaps(CDS)
#### LO 7.4: Explain the purposes and uses of credit default swaps.
- Credit default swaps (CDSs) are insurance contracts that pay off when some reference instrument (such as a bond or a CDO tranche) defaults.

### securitized and structured products
#### LO 7.5: Describe how securitized and structured products were used by investor groups and describe the consequences o f their increased use.
- reasons for growth
  - offer lower interest rates on mortgages
  - help overcome these regulatory hurdles(AAA)
  - Securitization provides regulatory and rating arbitrage opportunities
  - given high ratings based on faulty over-optimism


### consequences
#### LO 7.6: Describe how the financial crisis triggered a series o f worldwide financial and economic consequences.


### funding liquidity and market liquidity
#### LO 7.7: Distinguish between funding liquidity and market liquidity and explain how the evaporation o f liquidity can lead to a financial crisis.
- Funding liquidity refers to an institution’s ability to immediately settle obligations when they are due. If a bank is not able to settle its obligations on time, the bank is illiquid.
- Funding liquidity risk refers to the possibility that an institution will not be able to settle its obligations when they are due.
  - Margin/haircut funding risk: a decline in the collateral value
  - Rollover risk: not be able to roll over short-term debt to finance the purchase of an asset
  - Redemption risk: depositors will withdraw funds
- Market liquidity refers to the ease or difficulty of selling an asset to raise money.
  - Bid-ask spread
  - Market depth: volumn
  - Market resiliency: time to regain price
- with a loss spiral, a trader initiates a sale to maintain the leverage ratio; whereas with a margin spiral, a trader sells an asset to fulfill the requirements of a decline in the leverage ratio

### network risk
#### LO 7.8: Analyze how an increase in counterparty credit risk can generate additional funding needs and possible systemic risk.
- Network risk arises as a result of an increase in counterparty credit risk, particularly in an environment of market stress.
- Network risk is exacerbated by the absence of a clearinghouse, which is a central regulatory authority that can manage multilateral netting among multiple contracting parties that possess less than full information on one another.

- The subprime mortgage crisis reached its peak in June and July of 2007. 
- Asset-liability maturity mismatch refers to the purchase of long-term assets through short-term financing.
- A decline in funding has the same effect as an increase in required margin.
