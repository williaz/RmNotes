- Value at risk (VaR) is a probabilistic method of measuring the potential loss in portfolio value over a given time period and for a given distribution of historical returns.
- z: -2.33, -1.65, -1.28
- VaR can be converted from a 1-day basis to a longer basis by multiplying the daily VaR by the square root of the number of days (J) in the longer time period (called the square root rule).

- Linear methods replace portfolio positions with linear exposures on the appropriate risk factor.
  - VaR developed by a delta-normal method is more accurate over shorter horizons than longer horizons.

- Full valuation methods fully reprice the portfolio for each scenario encountered over a historical period, or over a great number of hypothetical scenarios developed through historical simulation or Monte Carlo simulation.
  - The Monte Carlo simulation approach revalues a portfolio for a large number of risk factor values, randomly selected from a normal distribution. 
  - Historical simulation revalues a portfolio using actual values for risk factors taken from historical data.

#### LO 52.1: Explain how asset return distributions tend to deviate from the normal distribution.
#### LO 52.2: Explain reasons for fat tails in a return distribution and describe their imphcations.
#### LO 52.3: Distinguish between conditional and unconditional distributions.



#### LO 52.4: Describe the implications of regime switching on quantifying volatility.


#### LO 52.5: Explain the various approaches for estimating VaR.
#### LO 52.6: Compare and contrast different parametric and non-parametric approaches for estimating conditional volatility.
#### LO 52.7: Calculate conditional volatility using parametric and non-parametric approaches.
- Smaller K or X parameter results in a higher weight to recent observations and a smaller sample window.

#### LO 52.8: Explain the process o f return aggregation in the context o f volatilityforecasting methods.

- The delta-normal method requires the calculation of A variances and \[N x (N — 1)] / 2 covariances for a portfolio of Appositions.
- The historical simulation approach requires an additional step that aggregates each period’s historical returns weighted(market value) according to the relative size of each position.

- A third approach to calculating VaR estimates the volatility of the vector of aggregated returns and assumes normality based on the strong law of large numbers.

#### LO 52.9: Evaluate implied volatility as a predictor o f future volatility and its shortcomings.

- The Black-Scholes-Merton model is used to infer an implied volatility from equity option prices. Using the most liquid at-the-money put and call options, an average implied volatility is extrapolated using the Black-Scholes-Merton model.
- Empirical results suggest implied volatility is on average greater than realized volatility.


#### LO 52.10: Explain long horizon volatility/VaR and the process o f mean reversion according to an AR(1) model.
#### LO 52.11: Calculate conditional volatility with and without mean reversion.
#### LO 52.12: Describe the impact o f mean reversion on long horizon conditional volatility estimation.

- If mean reversion exists, the long horizon risk (and the resulting VaR calculation) is smaller than square root volatility.
